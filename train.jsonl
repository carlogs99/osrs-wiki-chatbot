These areas contain an [[Agility course]] that players will need to complete to train their Agility. An Agility course is completed by successfully passing all obstacles. It is, however, possible to fail an obstacle, which will result in the character taking small amounts of damage. Therefore, it is advised to bring some [[food]] when planning on training Agility at lower Agility and [[Hitpoints]] levels.\n\nOn many courses, the amount of damage taken after failing an obstacle is based on your remaining [[Hitpoints]], so to conserve food it is often worthwhile to wait until your Hitpoints are low before eating. For example, falling into the lava might cause 12 points of damage in the [[Wilderness course]] if at full Hitpoints, but only 6 if there are just 20 Hitpoints left.\n\nFor the best experience rates, it is required to continually keep running around the courses. This might result in quickly draining the character's [[Energy|run energy]], therefore it can be helpful to bring some [[energy potion]]s, [[super energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s, or to wear [[weight-reducing clothing]] while training Agility:\n*{{plink|Graceful outfit|pic=Graceful hood}}\n*{{plink|Boots of lightness}}\n*{{plink|Spotted cape}}\n*{{plink|Spottier cape}}\n*{{plink|Penance gloves}}", "source": "articles\\Agility.txt"}

{"id": "697a1caca515-40", "text": "==Legacy==\nThough Artisan failed to pass a poll, its influences can be seen in many parts of the game today. Over the years, a number of features originally proposed as parts of Artisan have been added to the game or otherwise polled as parts of different proposed updates.\n*[[Redwood|Redwood tree]]s and [[redwood logs|logs]] were added to the game alongside the [[Woodcutting Guild]] in [[Update:The Woodcutting Guild|an update]] on [[2 June]] [[2016]]. Originally proposed with Artisan as a level 85 [[Woodcutting]] tree, the Redwood trees were [[Poll:Old School Content Poll 43: Great Kourend Content|re-polled]] as level 90 Woodcutting trees on [[13 May]] [[2016]] and passed with 87.6% support.\n*With {{UD|The Kebos Lowlands}} update came the [[pearl fishing rod]], [[pearl fly fishing rod]], and [[pearl barbarian rod]]. These wieldable rods are reminiscent of the \"Expert's fishing rod\" and \"Expert's fly fishing rod\" proposed with Artisan.\n*The [[light ballista|light]] and [[heavy ballista]]e added with {{UD|Monkey Madness II}} are reminiscent of Artisan's proposed two-handed crossbows. Though not identical in function, both concepts fit the niche of a slow, two-handed ranged weapon with a higher max hit than its one-handed counterparts.\n*Many of the ideas proposed with Artisan's clothing-making appeared as part of the proposed skill [[Warding]], which also failed to pass a [[poll]]. In particular, the process of farming plants to make cloth and using that cloth to craft clothing with [[Magic]] bonuses is very similar between both proposed skills.", "source": "articles\\Artisan.txt"}

To do this, the player uses a raw, cookable food on a [[range]] or [[fire]].\n\nDepending on the player's Cooking level, food will sometimes burn, becoming unusable. Ranges burn food less often than fires at the same level, and some foods can only be cooked on ranges. Some ranges, such as the [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|one]] in the [[Lumbridge Castle]] or in the [[Hosidius Kitchen]], burn food less often than a normal range.\n\nCooking goes hand-in-hand with the [[Fishing]] skill as the player can cook the fish they obtain. If no range is nearby, having an [[axe]] and [[tinderbox]] on hand can allow the player to cut down a tree and make a fire to cook the fish on.", "source": "articles\\Cooking.txt"}

Generally a player who is manually gathering their raw items will cook their food items on a local [[Fire|campfire]] created through the [[Firemaking]] skill near where they are gathering, or take the items they have obtained to a [[range]] and cook there.", "source": "articles\\Cooking.txt"}

Foods like [[bread]], [[cake]], and [[pie]] must be cooked on a proper range, Most of these food items will generate an error message if the player attempts to cook it improperly while others, such as raw potatoes, will simply all burn. Raw foods loosely related to the [[Hunter]] skill, such as [[raw beast meat]], [[raw chompy]], and [[raw rabbit meat|rabbit]], must be cooked on an iron spit.\n\nTo actually cook something, players have to \"use\" their raw food item on a range or a campfire. If they have more than one food item of the same kind in their inventory, a picture of the food item will appear in the dialogue box. Ranges can also be left-clicked to automatically bring up this interface.

These can work in conjunction with the cooking gauntlets. Unless the player is cooking something with 100% success rate, it is recommended to use these where possible to decrease the amount of burnt food. The recommended range to cook on for members is in the [[Hosidius Kitchen]], usable after gaining 100% [[Hosidius favour]]. This range grants a 5% increased chance to successfully cook food (10% if elite [[Kourend &amp; Kebos Diary|Kourend and Kebos diary]] completed) and is very close to a bank chest.\n\nThe [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|range]] in Lumbridge Castle also has a lower burn rate for some foods, usable after completing the [[Cook's Assistant]] quest.

{"id": "e4db655b6941-28", "text": "Although it is complex, somewhat expensive, and requires a wide variety of unusual ingredients, gnome cooking can provide a good way to level Cooking from around 10 up to about 30 in good speed. To obtain the cookbook with all the recipes for gnome foods, a player can go to [[The Grand Tree]] in the [[Gnome Stronghold]] and find [[Aluft Gianne Sr]]. He is on the west side of the first level up of the Grand Tree and is dressed as a chef. Talk with him, and offer your assistance to him. He will assign you a succession of dishes to prepare. Once you have prepared the dish to his satisfaction, he will ask you to make another, then another moving steadily up the assortment of gnome foods. If you are using this method to train your Cooking and get an assignment you do not have the correct level to prepare, then you simply need to train until you do. Use the shops and resources in the Gnome Stronghold to make more gnome foods if you wish, or cook other foods that you may have. For each dish, the player can buy supplies from the shop run by Hudo who is found by the cooking range nearby Gianne, but ever since the shop stock update this has been severely limited.

This works because the cooking interface is skipped when only one raw food item is in the inventory, and the item is cooked with no delay.

The crops grown range from [[Allotments|vegetables]], [[herbs]] and [[hops]], to wood-bearing [[Tree seed|trees]], [[Cactus seed|cacti]], and [[Mushroom patch|mushrooms]]. The harvested items have a wide variety of uses, and are popular for training [[Herblore]] and [[Cooking]]. Many players sell their harvest for a significant profit.\n\nThe plants grown in [[farming patches]] are accessible only to the player who grew them. This is especially useful in the case of wood-bearing trees. Like wild trees, player-grown trees can be chopped down for [[logs]] and [[Woodcutting]] experience, regenerating after a short period of time. But, as they're only accessible to the player who grew them, they can be cut without competition.", "source": "articles\\Farming.txt"}
{"id": "da7d88c20021-1", "text": "Planted crops grow according to set timings, continuing even after a player logs out. This makes it possible to gain large amounts of experience from little in-game time, especially when growing high-experience crops such as trees. Players can also gain rapid experience by planning [[farming run]]s that maximise the number of plants grown at once.\n\n{{Listen\n|align = right\n|title = Farming level up - normal\n|filename = Farming level up (normal).ogg\n|desc = The music that plays when levelling up.}}\n\n{{Listen\n|align = right\n|title = Farming level up - with unlocks\n|filename = Farming level up (with unlocks).ogg\n|desc = The music that plays when levelling up and unlocking new content.}}\n\n==General overview==\nThe first thing any player will do when they begin training this skill is to rake away the [[weeds]] from one of the many [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patches]] found scattered around ''RuneScape''. Once cleared, players have the option of applying compost to the patch, which will decrease the chance of the crop becoming diseased, and will also possibly increase the yield of the crop once it reaches maturity. \n[[File:Farming herbs.gif|frame|A player picking herbs grown from farming.]]", "source": "articles\\Farming.txt"}
{"id": "da7d88c20021-2", "text": "===Compost===\n[[Compost]] can be bought in farming shops, or obtained by placing a total of 15 weeds or various other unwanted vegetables into one of the [[compost bin]]s. [[Supercompost]], which results in an even higher yield and further lowers chances of disease, is obtained by filling the compost bin with higher level farming produce such as [[pineapple]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[calquat]]s, [[coconut]]s, and high end [[herbs]]. [[Ultracompost]] may be made by adding 25 [[volcanic ashes]] to a full bin of supercompost or adding two volcanic ashes to a bucket of supercompost. Players can also cast the [[Fertile Soil]] spell from the [[Lunar spellbook]] at any point during the plant's growth cycle to apply the effects of [[supercompost]].\n\n===Obtaining Seeds===\n[[Seeds]] are usually easy to obtain. They can be bought from players and stalls, stolen via [[Thieving]] or obtained as drops from an enormous variety of monsters. Any lower or intermediate level seeds are usually very cheap, ranging from 1-20 coins each, while the higher level seeds, such as [[Tree patch|tree]], [[Fruit tree seed|fruit tree]], and especially upper end [[herb seed]]s, are usually thousands of coins each, if not more.\n\n===Growth and Disease===\nAfter growing for a preset period of time crops will mature and can then be harvested, provided that the crops have not become diseased and died while growing. Once planted, crops grow even if the player is not online, so one can plant a [[seed]] and come back at any time. Once the crops are fully grown they will remain in the patch indefinitely until harvested; that is, they will not die once fully matured.", "source": "articles\\Farming.txt"}
{"id": "da7d88c20021-3", "text": "However, during this time crops have a chance to become [[Disease (Farming)|diseased]], and die if left unattended in this stage. While players may wish to check on their crops and cure diseased ones, this can prove a time intensive process. Use of supercompost or ultracompost significantly reduces disease risk. To guarantee plants reaching maturity, players can pay nearby [[Group of Advanced Gardeners|gardeners]] to watch crops.\n\nGardeners all charge for their services, but not in coins. The price that they ask depends on the crop that the player asks them to watch. For example, the price for protecting a patch of [[Potato seed|potatoes]] is two buckets of compost while the price for protecting a patch of [[Onion seed|onions]] is one [[sack of potatoes]]. They will also accept your payment-items in noted form. Gardeners cannot be paid to protect herbs or flowers. When the player has 50% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]], the allotment, flower, and herb patches there will be protected by the local farmer at all times. Players can also unlock two herb patches which are perpetually protected from disease, for free, by completing [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and [[Making Friends With My Arm]].\n\n==Farming equipment==\n\n===Tools===\nFor farming, there are certain tools you will need to use, whether it's using a [[rake]] to clear a patch or digging up dead plants with a [[spade]].

For a full list of growth stage durations and the number of stages for each type of crop, see [[Seeds]].

However, with the introduction of a new magic system, the lower skill was removed, and the higher skill changed to Magic. For example, if the player had level 50 Good Magic and level 40 Evil Magic, they would keep level 50 Magic, and the experience for the Evil Magic was discarded. Because of this, some players were upset that they lost money for training their lower magic skill, and that the experience was thrown away instead of carried over. There were also spells like Shock Bolt, Elemental Bolt, Camouflage, and Fear.\n*Prior to the introduction of ''RuneScape 2'', [[combat spells]] were universally represented by a simple, flying blue star, which proved difficult to distinguish from [[arrows]], which were green stars. Also, in ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', players were capable of casting magic spells while wearing full [[rune armour]], leading to a massive imbalance in favour of high-level mages.\n*Prior to the advent of [[multicombat area]]s in ''RuneScape 2'', mages and [[Ranged|archers]] could attack enemies while a [[melee]] fighter engaged the [[monster]] in direct [[combat]]. This was the most common way for multiple players to attack the same creature, usually high level bosses like the [[King Black Dragon]]. The loot would go to whoever dealt the most damage, and the person who dealt the last hit would be the only one to receive [[experience]], though less than if they had killed the monster themselves.", "source": "articles\\Magic.txt"}

With ''RuneScape 2'' came the introduction of [[Runecraft]] and many monsters with much higher rune drop rates, so runes became much easier to obtain. Accordingly, experience rates were also reduced to where they are today. Now normal spells generally gives (spell level + 10) experience and combat spells generally give a base experience of (spell level + 10)/2.\n*A ''Runescape Mythbusters'' episode aired on twitch revealed that a player's Magic level plays a role in defending against magic attacks.", "source": "articles\\Magic.txt"}

Different prayers drain prayer points at different rates. For example, a low-level prayer such as [[Thick Skin]] drains prayer significantly slower than its higher level counterpart, [[Steel Skin]].\n\n''Prayer bonus'', determined by worn equipment allows a player to slow the rate at which prayer points are drained. Players can view their prayer bonus in the [[Equipment Stats]] window. Only certain types of armour, clothing, [[weapons]], and [[jewellery]] grant a prayer bonus.\n\nIn practice, each point of prayer bonus effectively increases the duration prayer points will last by 3.33%. For example, if a player uses the \"[[Protect from Melee]]\" prayer with a prayer bonus of 0, their prayer points would drain at a rate of 1 point every 3 seconds. If that player then equips [[armour]] giving a prayer bonus of +15, the player can expect this duration to increase by 50%, draining 1 point per 4.5 seconds instead of 1 point every 3 seconds.\n\nPrayer bonus does not help to stave off the side-effects of locations and [[monsters]] that drain Prayer.", "source": "articles\\Prayer.txt"}

As this can occur more than once per game tick, it is possible to lose more than one prayer point within a single game tick.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/814540902542802944|date=29 December 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/hN26Q|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=The drain effect of the new Raids prayers is still subject to change.

It can be left-clicked to activate, or deactivate, a group of prayers preselected by the player simultaneously. You can select which prayers are activated by right-clicking the button and choosing the \"Setup quick-prayers\" option. Before the addition of this function, players had to, sometimes frantically, locate the prayer tab and activate them one by one. This function allows players to place many of the most useful prayers on immediate standby. It is very useful for prayer flicking. Quick prayers can also be used as an easy way to turn off all prayers by double left-clicking it (to turn quick prayers on, then off).\n\n==Prayer filtering==\nBy enabling the prayers filter via right-clicking the prayer icon, players may alter the contents of their prayers interface based on a number of filters by clicking the \"Filters\" button on the bottom of the prayer interface:\n* Lower tiers of tiered prayers\n* Tiered prayers even if multi-skill prayers are available\n* Rapid Healing prayers\n* Prayers the player lacks the Prayer level to activate\n* Prayers the player lacks the requirements to activate", "source": "articles\\Prayer.txt"}
{"id": "32f6b7426cc3-10", "text": "Once a player checks or unchecks the desired filter, tapping the \"Filters\" button again will display the filtered interface. Unlike the [[spellbook]] filtering, prayer icons will not enlarge if enough prayers are filtered out.\n\n==Prayer flicking==\nFlicking lets a player use prayers in combat without having their [[prayer points]] drain continuously. A skilled player will turn prayers on right before their effects are required, and turn them off immediately after. This will stop prayer from continuously draining between attacks. For prayer flicking involving [[protection prayers]], the player will activate the prayer just before being hit, and turn it off immediately after the hit lands. This uses up very few prayer points, and negates prayer point usage completely if done quickly enough.\n\nAlthough flicking requires timing and skill, doing it successfully can save prayer points and allow a player to fight [[monsters]] for much longer, or increase damage rates with offensive prayers. In some cases, flicking can take advantage of mechanics, such as rendering [[Dessous]] unable to attack the player. If done perfectly, no prayer will be consumed regardless of how long the fight lasts.\n\nMost players will not have totally perfect timing. Wearing gear with a high prayer bonus will help you prayer flick much longer. Flicking is considerably easier when fighting a monster that matches your weapon's speed, and/or when playing with sounds on. A metronome set to 100 beats per minute (or once every 0.6 seconds) can be used for practicing.\n\nThe disadvantages to prayer flicking are the high click intensity associated with constantly turning prayers on and off, and the time needed to get good and consistent at it. If used in a high risk situation, incorrectly flicking may backfire as it can cause players to not have prayers on at the right time.", "source": "articles\\Prayer.txt"}

If flicking a combat prayer, this is the tick you attack. If flicking a protection prayer, this is the tick your enemy attacks (which is when their attack animation begins, not necessarily the tick in which you take damage). If flicking against monsters, it will help immensely to know the monster's [[attack speed]].\n\n[[File:Prayer flicking (ranged).gif|thumb|Flicking offensively with a crossbow on the Rapid setting. Note that the XP drop and overhead prayer appear at the same time.]]\nWhile it is possible to prayer flick against monsters that use Magic or Ranged attacks, it is best to practice against monsters that use melee at a 2.4 second (4 tick) interval while using a 4-tick weapon if you are learning how to flick for the first time. Practicing during [[Slayer]] tasks is a relatively safe and yet rewarding way to learn. [[Mutated Bloodveld]]s are an example of a good monster to practice at: they are not aggressive, their hits are accurate (meaning you will see easily when you make a mistake), and they are easy to reach.", "source": "articles\\Prayer.txt"}

When using offensive prayers, activate the prayer just before your attack animation begins (and the experience drop shows up, if your hit is successful). To consume no prayer points, turn the prayer off within the next tick.\n\n'''Note:''' Latency to the server is unavoidable, usually the ping at 20 to 150 milliseconds to the closest server. Keep this in mind when prayer flicking.\n\nThere are some exceptions to the rule of protection prayer having to be active on the first tick of the attack: for example, many of [[TzTok-Jad]], [[The Nightmare]] and [[Verzik Vitur]]'s attacks are calculated shortly after the start of their attack animation to allow the player to react to them switching between their attacks.", "source": "articles\\Prayer.txt"}

Notably, this is the only way to reliably protect yourself in a multi-combat zone filled with aggressive enemies without expending prayer points, and works against enemies that cannot be reliably prayer-flicked against due to varying attack speeds (such as [[cave horror]]s). In addition, it can reliably be used for both protection and offensive prayers, to nullify and deal more damage at the same time.

It would allow players to explore and travel across the oceans on their own ship.\n\nOf the three proposed skills, the Sailing pitch received a plurality of votes in the [[Poll:Skill Pitches Poll|Skill Pitches Poll]] (36% favour), with Shamanism coming in as a close second (33% favour). Thus, Sailing is currently slated to undergo further refinement based on community feedback and potentially be added to the game.\n\n[[Jagex]] hosts a ''New Skill Player Council'' Discord server found [https://discord.gg/t8y9cKYyKS here], in which new skill related updates, modcasts, and community involvement take place.\n\n'''Note''': All designs, concepts, and discussions are '''NOT''' final and are subject to change.", "source": "articles\\Sailing.txt"}
{"id": "46fecb7246cb-1", "text": "==Concepts==\n===Navigation===\n====Ships====\nPlayers will be able to own a variety of ships, starting with a lower quality vessel and progressing towards better ships and upgrades. A higher Sailing level would grant the ability to command higher quality vessels, along with unlocking the ability to sail across more dangerous and exciting areas. To traverse between land and sea, players will make use of ports all around the world of [[Gielinor]]. Ports will also provide a number of utilities such as ship construction, repairs, customisation, crew hiring, and more. There will be alternative points of entry (e.g. mooring points) for locations where having a port would not make sense thematically, such as unsettled lands. While these will allow traversal between island and ship, they will lack all other utilities provided by ports.\n\nPlayers will be on the actual decks of ships and able to move around via the traditional point-and-click control scheme (a tech demo prototype showcasing this can be found below). Controlling the ship will involve interacting with the Ship's wheel to enter Navigation Mode, in which the camera becomes centered on to the ship. To move the ship, the player can simply click on a sea tile and have the ship sail towards it, eventually coming to a stop once it's reached its destination. Perpetual momentum, in which ships continue to sail in a given direction until obstructed, is also being looked into, possibly as a perk unlock. To exit Navigation Mode, the player can click on the Ship's wheel once again and the camera will re-centre on to the player. It is currently unknown exactly how the control schemes will differ between different ship types.", "source": "articles\\Sailing.txt"}
{"id": "46fecb7246cb-2", "text": "The ships would be customisable, allowing players to show off their achievements at sea, and will feature facilities (similar to [[hotspots]]) that can be outfitted with various upgrades or utilities to interact with. Some given examples of facilities are fishing apparatuses, cargo holds of different sizes, naval weapons (ballistae, cannons, etc.), ship kitchens, or even a crow's nest featuring a detachable camera for better surveyance. Ships will also feature a number of variables that affect how they fare out in sea, such as size, speed, turning speed, and quantity of facilities and floors allowed on the ship. There are three main ship types currently proposed:", "source": "articles\\Sailing.txt"}

{"id": "46fecb7246cb-4", "text": "====The Sea====\nThe current scale of the world tends to make the relative scale of ship and sea to seem a bit \"wonky\", however the developers will be taking this into consideration when designing the ship and sea regions to minimize that sense. New tech is also being looked into for providing a more immersive sailing experience, such as unrendering certain irrelevant areas while sailing to make the sea seem more expansive.\n\nThe sea is currently planned to have three different tiers of sea types: shallow, open, and deep. These types of sea will determine which ships can traverse them and how well they will do so. Certain lands are currently inaccessible until the player achieves a certain milestone, such as completing a quest. These lands will feature immersive restrictions for players who attempt to sail out to them prior to achieving their requirements (e.g. [[Elvarg]] will attack ships if the player sails to [[Crandor]] and hasn't completed [[Dragon Slayer I]]). Since an amateur sailor in a rowboat won't be able to take on everything the sea will throw at them, there will be Sailing-specific progression restrictions as well. Some examples include requiring stronger sails for storms, stronger hulls for reefs, stronger cannons for sea monsters, or enchanted navigational devices for traversing fogged regions.\n\nWhen sailing into the edge of the map, the team would prefer a more immersive restriction rather than hard stops, and have proposed the edges to feature an endless sea with scenery, but also with hazards that push ships back or even deal damage to those who stay too long in the endless sea borders.", "source": "articles\\Sailing.txt"}
{"id": "46fecb7246cb-5", "text": "Weather is an integral part of navigation, and as such will present some obstacles within Sailing. It is planned to have the more difficult types of weather to be further out at sea, which is geared more towards end-game Sailing content. Some examples of sailing speed-impacting weather include dynamic winds (emergent which will require adaptation) and static currents (always present in the same location and can be preemptively planned around). \n\nThe skill's launch will also feature a complete graphical overhaul of Gielinor's oceans, such as coral reefs, currents, and visual differences for the variety of sea types.\n\n===Gameplay loop===\n{{Blockquote|Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an explorer setting foot on unexplored territory, a fisherman hoping for a monster catch, a pirate looking to sink every ship in sight, or even a courier looking to move goods from A to B, Sailing has something to offer everyone.

Potential ideas for activities include:\n* Deep sea fishing\n* Hunting elusive sea creatures\n* Navigational challenges, which involve safely navigating the ship across an obstacle or threat\n* Courier missions where cargo must be delivered between certain points\n* Uncovering new islands to explore\n\nPassive gameplay would also be included, which would give less experience than active gameplay.

Afterwards, it had become a subject of jokes both by Jagex Moderators, through references and {{wp|April Fools}} jokes, and the community. In ''Old School RuneScape'', the [[2014 April Fools]] event centred on Sailing being released as a new skill. However, sixteen months later (August 2015), the Jagex Old School Runescape team considered Sailing as a potential real skill.", "source": "articles\\Sailing_(2015_proposed_skill).txt"}

It would allow players to use gathered materials in rituals to create powerful items, along with the ability to access the Spirit Realm, which would likely be similar to {{RSL|Spirit Realm|its incarnation in ''RuneScape''}}.\n\nThe skill concept came in second place in a [[Poll:Skill Pitches Poll|poll]], and as such has been currently shelved for potential future use due to outstanding player support.\n\n==Gameplay loop==\n{{Blockquote|Study the magical power of nature through Shamanism and unlock the ability to perform rituals. Gather components, perform rituals, and infuse objects with the magic of the Spirit Realm. Create powerful items like Tikis, Totems and Poultices, and augment your own equipment with powerful new effects.|Official tagline from the initial proposal.}}\n\nThe core gameplay loop of the skill would involve:\n# Foraging for natural components throughout the world.\n# Gathering spiritual components at Disturbed Sites.\n# Drawing a ritual circle anywhere in the world.\n# Creating powerful shamanic items through rituals.\n\nNatural components (eg. mushrooms, tree bark, berries, etc.) would be found in new nodes scattered across the game, and could be foraged with a high enough Shamanism level. They could also be gathered from monsters using a carving knife, which would give different components depending on the monster harvested (eg. bone marrow, blood, organs, etc.).", "source": "articles\\Shamanism.txt"}
{"id": "f38a1d3efef4-1", "text": "Spiritual components (physical manifestations of magic) would be gathered from special nodes called Disturbed Sites \u00e2\u20ac\u201d places where the veil between the Spirit Realm and the physical world is thinner than other areas.\n\nA majority of both components would have been untradeable.\n\nThe two types of components would then be combined into new items using a ritual circle, which could be drawn in most outdoor areas, similar to [[fire]]s.\n\nA higher Shamanism level would grant access to more rituals and deeper parts of the Spirit Realm.\n\n==Details==\n===Spirit Realm===\nThe Spirit Realm is a mirrored version of Gielinor where everything is opposite to the physical world and vice versa. For example, a door that is locked in the physical world would be unlocked in the Spirit Realm. Shamanism would allow players to jump between the two worlds in order to discover secrets and unlock paths that would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\n===Utility items===\nItems created using the Shamanism skill, such as relics and totems, would provide some form of utility. Potential examples given included weapon/armour augmentation (such as stat increases or new damage types) and gear augmentation (such as skilling tool enhancers).\n\n{{Skills}}</text>", "source": "articles\\Shamanism.txt"}

Skills are [[trained]] by repeating actions that give [[experience]] in the skill until enough experience is earned to advance to the next level. Skills range from cooking [[food]], to chopping [[trees]] and to casting [[magic]]. Some skills are \"interlaced\", meaning that they can be used together. For example, [[logs]] obtained from [[Woodcutting]] can be lit for [[Firemaking]], which can then be used to cook food for [[Cooking]].\n\n[[File:Skills level-up.gif|thumb|200px|A player levels up a skill.]]\n{{Listen\n|title = Level up fireworks\n|desc = The sound effect when a player levels up.\n|filename = Level up fireworks.ogg\n}}\n\nThere are 23 different skills in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''.\n\nAll skills start out at level 1 except for [[Hitpoints]], which starts with level 10. Players can advance a skill to [[level 99]]. After that, they can increase their experience up to 200,000,000 but get no more levels for doing so. See [[Hiscores]] for the relative rankings of the different skills.\n\nA player could bring a level of a skill to 100 while wearing a [[Cape of Accomplishment]] of that skill, with no significant bonus; it is mostly done just for the feeling of having a skill boosted over the level 99 mark. Skills can also be temporarily boosted through special equipment, items, [[Prayer]], or [[potions]].", "source": "articles\\Skills.txt"}

{"id": "e433481938fe-6", "text": "==Experience increase==\nThe amount of [[experience]] needed for every level-up increases approximately by 10% for every level. This is shown in the way that it is 83 experience between levels 1 and 2, but 91 experience between levels 2 and 3. (10% of 83 is roughly 8, therefore the next level-up would require 91 experience.) The required experience for each level-up grows exponentially; the growth of experience gaps between levels gets larger and larger at higher levels. The [[Experience|experience table]] clearly indicates this.\n\nIn addition, the experience required doubles approximately every seven levels. For example, the experience needed for level 92 in a skill is almost exactly half of that needed to reach level 99.\n\nThe below equation directly gives the number of experience per level:\n\n&lt;math&gt;\\text{Total experience} = \\left \\lfloor \\frac {\\sum_{x = 1} ^ {L - 1} \\left \\lfloor x + 300 \\times 2 ^ \\frac {x} {7} \\right \\rfloor} {4} \\right \\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;\n\nThis can be further derived into a closed-form function with a positive real variable L (standing for level), although this requires ignoring one floor function of the exact formula and thus contains an exceedingly minor error margin. The approximation rapidly approaches the original sum asymptotically. The function is as follows:\n\n&lt;math&gt;\\text{Total experience} \\approx \\left \\lfloor \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\left( {L}^{2} - L \\right) + 75 \\cdot \\frac{{2}^{\\frac{L-1}{7}}-1} {1 - \\sqrt[7]{0.5}} \\right \\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;", "source": "articles\\Skills.txt"}

Players must visit a [[Slayer Master]], who will assign them a [[Slayer task|task]] to kill certain monsters based on the player's [[Combat level]]. Slayer [[experience]] is roughly equal to a slain monster's [[Hitpoints]], and is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster.\n\nMany players primarily train [[Combat]] by completing [[Slayer task]]s, as Combat experience is still given as normal while fighting [[Slayer monsters]]. Slayer is a very profitable skill to train, as high levelled Slayer monsters, such as [[Slayer bosses]] have a multitude of both rare and valuable drops.\n\nAs of [[12 December]] [[2013]], players can earn [[Slayer points]] by completing assigned tasks.\n\n{{Listen\n|align = right\n|title = Slayer level up - normal\n|filename = Slayer level up (normal).ogg\n|desc = The music that plays when levelling up.}}", "source": "articles\\Slayer.txt"}

All but two Slayer Masters have a [[Combat level]] requirement, and the final Slayer Master also has a Slayer level requirement. The tasks assigned are generally appropriate for the Combat level of the player, assuming they use the highest level Master available. Players may be assigned normal monsters to kill, or they may be assigned monsters that require the use of Slayer-specific [[Slayer equipment|items]] to deal damage or Slayer-specific [[armour]] to prevent stat reduction.\n\nThe [[Slayer equipment]] necessary to kill Slayer monsters can be purchased from any Slayer Master. When you get your task, you can ask the Master for advice on killing the assigned monsters, and they will tell you if special equipment is required. If no special equipment is necessary, they will give you other tips or advice such as if the monster is weak to [[poison]] or [[Magic]].\n\nOne of the things the Masters sell is an [[enchanted gem]]. Once you start training (this involves some begging from your chosen Master), you get one for free. Afterwards, you can buy them for 1 [[coin]] each. These allow you to contact your Slayer Master, ask for tips, ask who the monster is and where it is located, and most importantly, see how many monsters you still have to kill before completing the task. The gems cannot be used to get a new assignment; for that, you must see a Master in person. An alternative to the gem is a [[combat bracelet]], which will update the player every 10 kills while worn.", "source": "articles\\Slayer.txt"}
{"id": "51baf8a7a940-2", "text": "Players who have unlocked the [[Lunar Spells]] can also use the [[NPC Contact]] [[spell]] in order to receive a new assignment from a Slayer Master of their choosing. The Slayer gems automatically contact the Slayer Master most suited to your combat level; this may not be the one who gave you the assignment. It is advised to receive tasks from the Slayer Master the gems contact for you.\n\nThe Masters vary in the level of difficulty of their assignments; several of them require certain combat levels before you may get assignments from them. If you go to a Slayer Master that is too hard for you, [[Turael]] in [[Burthorpe]] may consider giving you an easier assignment if the task is something that he doesn't normally assign. For example, if [[Vannaka]] assigns you [[desert lizards]], then Turael cannot change your task, as he too assigns desert lizards. The Masters are shown on the [[map]] with a yellow skull [[File:Slayer Master icon.png]] [[icon]].\n\n'''Note:''' Skipping assignments through Turael is '''not''' a recommended choice, as it's better to gain [[Slayer points]] from doing tasks in a row and spending it on blocking or skipping your current task without breaking your task streak, as Slayer points also allow you to buy useful items and perks.\n\n==Slayer Masters==\nA handful of [[Slayer Master]]s dot the map; each Master gives assignments oriented towards a general range of [[Combat level]]s.", "source": "articles\\Slayer.txt"}

{"id": "bcb0a50b6c95-8", "text": "==Smithing==\n{{Otheruses|def=no|a list of anvils|Anvil}}\nSmithing is the process by which players craft a [[metal]] item out of one or more metal [[bar]]s. Smithing is always done at an [[anvil]], using a [[hammer]] or an [[imcando hammer]]. When a player clicks on an anvil or uses a metal bar with one, an overlay is shown in which the player selects which item to forge. The player can either click the item to smith one such item, or right-click on the item and select a higher quantity of items to smith. Smithing takes place at a time interval of 5 [[tick]]s (roughly 3 seconds) per item created, regardless of the items being created or how many bars are being used per item.\n\n:'''Note:''' Once a player has selected a quantity of items to smith, the player's character will only cease smithing once the quantity is filled, the player has run out of bars, the player levels up, or the player is attacked.\n\n===Smithing tables===\nDifferent Smithing levels are required to make different items. Below is a table with information about Smithing and what players can create. It is important to note that [[Black equipment|black armour and weapons]] '''cannot''' be smithed.\n\nSmithing experience is calculated by taking the experience granted from 1 bar and multiplying it by the number of bars used. For example, a [[bronze platebody]] is 62.5 experience using 5 bars. 1 bar is 12.5 exp, so go 5 * 12.5 = 62.5. This works for all bars and all smithing items, with a few exceptions such as [[cannonball]]s.", "source": "articles\\Smithing.txt"}

These swords must be hammered, ground and polished at precise temperatures, which can be controlled by dipping it in water or lava.

The [[Port Phasmatys]], [[Neitiznot]] and [[Falador]] furnaces are also all quite close to banks. The Edgeville furnace also gives a chance to smelt two ores at once while wearing Varrock armour with each completed set of [[Varrock Diary]].\n*It is often more efficient to break up the tasks of [[mining]], smelting (unless [[Superheat Item|superheating]]), and smithing, rather than trying to mine 28 [[ores]], smelt them, and then smith them (although in Al Kharid the furnace is on the way to the bank).", "source": "articles\\Smithing.txt"}

Players have the option to cast [[High Level Alchemy]] on the items they made with smithing, sell them to specialty [[general store]]s, or sell them on the [[Grand Exchange]]. Furthermore, members have the ability to smelt metal [[bars]] at the [[Blast Furnace]] for lowered ore costs and therefore greater profits.\n\nSmithing in conjunction with casting High Level Alchemy is responsible for bringing significant amount of coins into the game. At a [[Magic]] level of 55, a player can \"high alch\" items using 5 [[fire rune]]s and 1 [[nature rune]] to turn items into coins. Several items made by Smithing can be profitable when [[High Alchemy]] is cast on them. Some high alchemy values are found in the table below.\n\nSpecialty stores are general stores that purchase items from the player for more coins than most general stores.

Of the four [[melee]] attack styles available, Strength experience is only awarded when fighting in the aggressive or controlled stances.", "source": "articles\\Strength.txt"}
{"id": "9701f6110d95-1", "text": "When fighting in the aggressive stance, &lt;math&gt;4 * x&lt;/math&gt; Strength experience is granted per hit, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of damage dealt. Fighting using the controlled stance, however, grants &lt;math&gt;1.33 * x&lt;/math&gt; Strength experience per hit, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of damage dealt. For example, a player who hits a 1 would receive 4 Strength experience when fighting in the aggressive stance and 1.33 Strength experience when fighting in the controlled stance. The amount of experience received when fighting in the controlled stance is calculated in the same way that experience awarded to the [[Hitpoints]] skill is calculated.\n\nThe difference between these two stances is that the aggressive stance solely provides experience for the Strength and Hitpoints [[skills]], whereas the controlled stance distributes experience equally among Strength, [[Attack]], [[Defence]], and Hitpoints. A player who hits a 1 would receive 1.33 experience in each one of these skills when in the controlled stance.\n\n==Fighting aggressively==\nIn order to gain [[experience]] in Strength, players must choose the ''aggressive'' [[Combat Options|attack style]]. Fighting aggressively grants players an invisible +3 Strength bonus (as detailed below), meaning players will hit for higher levels of damage than they would if they were fighting accurately or defensively.\n\n==Strength bonus==\nSome [[weapons]] give players a ''Strength bonus''. This bonus, represented as a single numerical value, represents the value of Strength gain. A +1 increase in Strength bonus IS NOT equivalent to +1 Strength skill, but is rather an indicator of the ability of weapons and [[armour]] to allow the player to deal higher amounts of damage.", "source": "articles\\Strength.txt"}

Three summoning spells were ultimately conceived: ''\"Call animal\"'', ''\"Raise skeleton\"'', and ''\"Summon demon\"'', all of which would have made use of a new type of [[Runes|runestone]], the {{RSCL|Life-Rune|xt=life rune}}. While the summoning spells were never released in ''RuneScape Classic'', players still discovered the existence of the unobtainable life rune. The idea of Summoning was revisited after the release of ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', and summoning spells that would let you \"summon skeletons, demons, etc...!\" were mentioned in the [[Update:Upcoming RuneScape updates|upcoming RuneScape updates newspost]] that released a couple of days after ''RuneScape 2'' launched. With the magic skill already receiving a large expansion with the release of [[Desert Treasure I]] and [[Ancient Magicks]], the idea of Summoning as an expansion to magic was subsequently abandoned in favour of making it a full-fledged skill. The first design brief for Summoning was written in early [[2005]] by {{RSL|Mod Bennett}} after he finished development of the [[Slayer]] [[skill]], but it was rejected due to not fitting with the rest of the game and not having a broad enough appeal.{{CiteDevBlog|author=Paul Gower, Mod Mark|url=https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Diary_-_Summoning:_Part_1_-_Concept|title=Summoning: Part 1 - Concept|blogdate=22 November 2007|name=Summoning Part 1}}", "source": "articles\\Summoning.txt"}

Jagex also came up with new ideas for how the skill would work mechanically, such as the animals working similarly to the existing [[cat]] [[pets]], with players levelling up the skill by having one following them as they went about their business. In late 2005, {{RSL|Mod Wilson}} created an early prototype of a new pet while developing the [[Rum Deal]] quest - the [[Karamthulhu (unused pet)|Karamthulhu]].

If successful, you will gain Thieving [[experience]] and possibly coins or various items. However, it is possible for the NPC to notice a pickpocket, in which case the NPC will yell \"What do you think you're doing?\" or some other surprised saying and hit the player, dealing a small amount of damage and [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them for several seconds, during which time the player cannot continue pickpocketing or move. Because of the possibility for damage, it is recommended that players bring [[food]] - cheap foods such as [[wine]] work well.\n\nCoins obtained via pickpocketing are obtained via [[coin pouch]]es. Players can have a stack of up to 28 coin pouches in their inventory, after which they must open them before they can pickpocket more. Players can quickly open a stack of coin pouches with a single left-click. After completion of the [[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diaries]] players are able to stack more than 28 pouches, with the max being 140 after completion of the Elite Diary.\n\n===Tips &amp; Tricks===\nNPCs may be pickpocketed every 2 ticks (1.2 seconds). There is no need to wait until the pickpocket animation is finished before pickpocketing again. Another attempt may be performed as soon as the sound of the item entering the player's [[inventory]] is played and the experience is given.

In the correct position, the player should be able to right-click to open the interaction menu, then left-click to pickpocket without moving their mouse down to select the option.\n\nAlternatively, just use Runelite's menu entry swapper to save yourself the headache.\n\n===Equipment===\nThe [[armour|equipment]] that a player wears mostly does not affect pickpocketing, aside from several exceptions listed below.

There are two types: elemental and catalytic, both types are created by the player via a channeling lamp.\n*Elemental wardstones are a mixture of elemental vis and steatite and are used to draw elemental wards onto the ground. Steatite can be purchased from rune shops or can be mined with level 15 mining. Once an elemental ward has been drawn it can be used as a surface for warding.\n*Catalytic wardstones are a mixture of catalytic vis and abraxas and are used to draw battle wards onto the ground. Abraxas can be obtained from monster drops or bought at rune shops. Once a battle ward has been drawn it will begin applying various magical buffs to nearby players.", "source": "articles\\Warding.txt"}

This is because more individual trees can spend time respawning and each player isn't wasting ticks swinging at a depleted tree.
