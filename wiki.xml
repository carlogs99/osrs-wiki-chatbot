[[File:Skills tab.png|thumb|right|The skills interface.]]
[[File:Stats icon.png|left|alt=Skills icon]] 
'''Skills''' are a player's attributes that can be advanced throughout the game. Skills are [[trained]] by repeating actions that give [[experience]] in the skill until enough experience is earned to advance to the next level. Skills range from cooking [[food]], to chopping [[trees]] and to casting [[magic]]. Some skills are "interlaced", meaning that they can be used together. For example, [[logs]] obtained from [[Woodcutting]] can be lit for [[Firemaking]], which can then be used to cook food for [[Cooking]].

[[File:Skills level-up.gif|thumb|200px|A player levels up a skill.]]
{{Listen
|title = Level up fireworks
|desc = The sound effect when a player levels up.
|filename = Level up fireworks.ogg
}}

There are 23 different skills in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''.

All skills start out at level 1 except for [[Hitpoints]], which starts with level 10. Players can advance a skill to [[level 99]]. After that, they can increase their experience up to 200,000,000 but get no more levels for doing so. See [[Hiscores]] for the relative rankings of the different skills.

A player could bring a level of a skill to 100 while wearing a [[Cape of Accomplishment]] of that skill, with no significant bonus; it is mostly done just for the feeling of having a skill boosted over the level 99 mark. Skills can also be temporarily boosted through special equipment, items, [[Prayer]], or [[potions]].

All players are currently displayed on the [[Hiscores]] regardless of level attained.

==Skill types==
As defined by Jagex, there are four types of skills: Combat, Gathering, Production and Utility.{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/adding-a-new-skill-community-consultation?oldschool=1|title=Adding A New Skill: Community Consultation|newsdate=23 January 2022}}

'''Combat skills''' - These skills involve fighting in [[Combat]].
:{{SCP|Attack|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Defence|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Hitpoints|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Magic|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Prayer|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Ranged|link=yes}}, and {{SCP|Strength|link=yes}}.
'''Gathering skills''' - These skills involve obtaining resources or items from the environment.
:{{SCP|Farming|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Fishing|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Hunter|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Mining|link=yes}}, and {{SCP|Woodcutting|link=yes}}.
'''Production skills''' - These skills involve processing items obtained through gathering skills into finished products.
:{{SCP|Cooking|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Crafting|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Fletching|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Herblore|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Runecraft|link=yes}}, and {{SCP|Smithing|link=yes}}.
'''Utility skills''' - These skills do not share a single cohesive theme, but usually reward the player with a variety of benefits.
:{{SCP|Agility|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Construction|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Firemaking|link=yes}}, {{SCP|Slayer|link=yes}}, and {{SCP|Thieving|link=yes}}.

==Experience increase==
The amount of [[experience]] needed for every level-up increases approximately by 10% for every level. This is shown in the way that it is 83 experience between levels 1 and 2, but 91 experience between levels 2 and 3. (10% of 83 is roughly 8, therefore the next level-up would require 91 experience.) The required experience for each level-up grows exponentially; the growth of experience gaps between levels gets larger and larger at higher levels. The [[Experience|experience table]] clearly indicates this.

In addition, the experience required doubles approximately every seven levels. For example, the experience needed for level 92 in a skill is almost exactly half of that needed to reach level 99.

The below equation directly gives the number of experience per level:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Total experience} = \left \lfloor \frac {\sum_{x = 1} ^ {L - 1} \left \lfloor x + 300 \times 2 ^ \frac {x} {7} \right \rfloor} {4} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

This can be further derived into a closed-form function with a positive real variable L (standing for level), although this requires ignoring one floor function of the exact formula and thus contains an exceedingly minor error margin. The approximation rapidly approaches the original sum asymptotically. The function is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\text{Total experience} \approx \left \lfloor \frac{1}{8} \cdot \left( {L}^{2} - L \right) + 75 \cdot \frac{{2}^{\frac{L-1}{7}}-1} {1 - \sqrt[7]{0.5}} \right \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

==Proposed skills==
Several new skills have been proposed since the release of ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'', but none have successfully passed a [[poll]] to be added.

===Sailing===
{{Main|Sailing}}
Sailing was first added as part of the [[2014 April Fools]] event, then later developed to become a proper skill in [[2015]] and polled on [[Poll:Sailing_Skill|10 September]]. Sailing would have been [[free-to-play]], and involved building various types of ships and navigating them to new regions. A redesigned version of Sailing was proposed in [[Update:Adding_A_New_Skill:_Introducing_Sailing,_Taming_and_Shamanism|March 2023]], alongside [[Shamanism]] and [[Taming]], as a concept for a potential new skill to be developed. It was polled against Shamanism and Taming on [[Poll:Skill_Pitches_Poll|4 April]], receiving the most votes. The redesigned Sailing is currently being developed and to be polled in the future.

===Artisan===
{{Main|Artisan}}
Artisan was developed in [[2014]] and was polled twice on [[Poll:Old School feature poll - Artisan and Bounty Hunter|17 July]] and [[Poll:Old School feature poll - Artisan Skill|21 August]]. Artisan would have been similar to [[Slayer]], but for skills, rather than combat. The skill would have involved getting tasks from Artisan masters, then gathering and crafting specific items to gain [[experience]]. Some content originally designed for Artisan was repurposed and released separately, such as [[Redwood Tree]]s and wieldable [[Pearl fishing rod|fishing rods]] from [[Aerial fishing]].

===Warding===
{{Main|Warding}}
Warding was first announced at [[rsw:RuneFest 2018|RuneFest 2018]] and was developed over the course of [[2019]]. The skill would have involved creation of magical robes and armour using fabrics and vis. Warding was polled on [[Poll:Warding Skill|19 July]].

===Shamanism===
{{Main|Shamanism}}
Shamanism was proposed in [[Update:Adding_A_New_Skill:_Introducing_Sailing,_Taming_and_Shamanism|March 2023]], alongside Taming and a redesigned Sailing, as a concept for a potential new skill to be developed. Shamanism would have focused on gathering materials and using them to craft items imbued with shamanistic magic, such as relics or totems. The Spirit Realm would have also been added, to be accessed through Shamanism. It was polled against Sailing and Taming on [[Poll:Skill_Pitches_Poll|4 April]], receiving the second most votes and losing to Sailing. Despite losing the poll, it was considered popular enough for the concept to be retained for potential development in the future.

===Taming===
{{Main|Taming}}
Taming was proposed in [[Update:Adding_A_New_Skill:_Introducing_Sailing,_Taming_and_Shamanism|March 2023]], alongside Shamanism and a redesigned Sailing, as a concept for a potential new skill to be developed. Taming would have focused on taming creatures, which could be trained. Trained creatures would have been able to assist a player in a variety of ways, such as unlocking new areas, or assisting with other skills. It was polled against Sailing and Shamanism on [[Poll:Skill_Pitches_Poll|4 April]], where it received the least votes, resulting in the concept being scrapped.

! colspan="5" | As of {{200mxp|Update}}

'''200 million experience''' is the maximum amount of [[experience]] that a [[Account|player]] can obtain in any one [[skill]], an achievement over 1,800 players have reached as of [[1 May]] [[2020]]. This amount of experience represents a large time investment, with each skill taking hundreds or thousands of hours of efficient playing. At current rates, obtaining 200 million experience in all skills takes approximately 13,500 hours of playing at minimum, using the best methods available. 

The first player to achieve 200 million experience in all skills was ''Lynx Titan'' on 28 December 2018, approximately six years after ''Old School RuneScape''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s release.{{CiteTwitter|author=Old School RuneScape|url=https://twitter.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1078975572980756481|date=29 December 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ORpPO|archivedate=17 January 2019|quote=Yesterday saw perhaps the most incredible achievement in Old School RuneScape to date. Join us in congratulating Lynx Titan, the first player to achieve 200m XP in all skills. His place at the top is cemented, and is well deserved!}}

The first ironman to achieve the same feat was ''Iron Hyger'' on 1 December 2022, nearly four years after ''Lynx Titan'', and just over 8 years after the release of the ironman game mode.{{CiteReddit|title=Iron Hyger OFFICIALLY cements his place as the #1 ironman by being the first to achieve 4.6b xp, over 20k hours played|author=u/Rezs|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/z9zn8g/iron_hyger_officially_cements_his_place_as_the_1/|date=1 December 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/GQxmt|archivedate=5 December 2022|quote=Iron Hyger OFFICIALLY cements his place as the #1 ironman by being the first to achieve 4.6b xp, over 20k hours played}}

In-game, having 200 million experience in a skill provides no practical reward or benefit, apart from making the player fifteen times more likely to receive a [[skilling pet]] in the appropriate skill.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Kieren|url=https://twitter.com/JagexKieren/status/784723957450702848|date=8 October 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/26iPj|archivedate=24 May 2020|quote=yep. 15x more likely.}} There are no notifications for achieving 200 million experience, although the first two to achieve it in all skills received a chatbox message saying "''Congratulations, [player name]!''" accompanied by a picture of [[beer]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1160811611256492032|date=12 August 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/gNnLX|archivedate=24 May 2020|quote=No, just "Congratulations [name]" and a picture of beer. But rather more fireworks this time than before, I think.}} 200 million experience was chosen as the maximum amount due to experience being stored as a {{wp|32-bit computing|32-bit}} signed integer with one decimal point: the maximum experience that could be stored is 214,748,364.7, although it was limited to a round number.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/957944398150602752|date=29 January 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/xtXW3|archivedate=24 May 2020|quote=It's stored as a 32-bit INT that's treated as a fixed-point number with one decimal place. So it'll take numbers up to 2 billion, which it treats as numbers up to 200,000,000.0, hence the 200 million XP cap you see.}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/952730930866683904|date=15 January 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/Xyveo|archivedate=24 May 2020|quote=The system can handle numbers up to 2.147 billion. It's storing a decimal place for the XP, so that'd be okay up to 214.7 million. And the original devs apparently decided to cap it at a round number.}}

===First players to reach 200 million experience in a skill===
Below is a list of the first players to reach 200 million experience in a particular skill. The list is periodically updated for account renames. If a player was permanently banned after being the first to reach 200 million experience and thus removed from the [[hiscores]], their hiscore entry is not linked, and if available, proof of their ban is cited.

===All accounts===
''Old School RuneScape was released 22 February 2013. [[Construction]] was unavailable until 5 March 2013.''

'''Agility''' is a [[Members|members-only]] [[skill]] which gives access to various [[shortcuts]] around ''[[RuneScape]]''. Other benefits of the skill include faster [[run energy]] restoration and the ability to obtain the [[graceful outfit]]. Note that the faster energy restore rate also applies in free-to-play worlds.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/563708004269555714|date=6 February 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/jYBtD|archivedate=12 February 2021|quote=Run energy restores faster at high Agility, including on F2P worlds.

__TOC__

==Agility Training Areas==
Agility Training Areas are identified with a running figure [[File:Agility training icon.png]] [[icon]] on the [[world map]]. These areas contain an [[Agility course]] that players will need to complete to train their Agility. An Agility course is completed by successfully passing all obstacles. It is, however, possible to fail an obstacle, which will result in the character taking small amounts of damage. Therefore, it is advised to bring some [[food]] when planning on training Agility at lower Agility and [[Hitpoints]] levels.

On many courses, the amount of damage taken after failing an obstacle is based on your remaining [[Hitpoints]], so to conserve food it is often worthwhile to wait until your Hitpoints are low before eating. For example, falling into the lava might cause 12 points of damage in the [[Wilderness course]] if at full Hitpoints, but only 6 if there are just 20 Hitpoints left.

For the best experience rates, it is required to continually keep running around the courses. This might result in quickly draining the character's [[Energy|run energy]], therefore it can be helpful to bring some [[energy potion]]s, [[super energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s, or to wear [[weight-reducing clothing]] while training Agility:
*{{plink|Graceful outfit|pic=Graceful hood}}
*{{plink|Boots of lightness}}
*{{plink|Spotted cape}}
*{{plink|Spottier cape}}
*{{plink|Penance gloves}}

''Contrary to popular belief, weight '''does not''' affect the chance of success for most obstacles.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/809140601446875136|date=14 December 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/SLrCO|archivedate=25 May 2020|quote=Your Agility level does, your weight does not.}} However, there are a few obstacles which were differently coded for certain quests and activities, such as the Zip line from the [[Werewolf Agility Course]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1158672314575261697|date=6 August 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/UQLEc|archivedate=25 May 2020|quote=If your Agility and Strength are over 80 and your carried weight is under 2kg, it looks like the code will indeed do that.}}''

==Regular courses==
These courses consist of completing a circuit of obstacles.

===Gnome Stronghold Agility Course===
{{Main|Gnome Stronghold Agility Course}}
The [[Gnome Stronghold Agility Course]] is the Agility course that most players will start at when planning on training their Agility. This course has no requirements to access and is very easy to follow. Additionally, it is impossible to fail any of the obstacles at this course, so it is not necessary to bring any [[food]]. However, some [[energy potion]]s, [[super energy potion]]s or [[stamina potion]]s may be helpful for faster training.

This course is located near the [[Grand Tree]] in the [[Tree Gnome Stronghold]], north-west of [[Ardougne]].

A lap will take a minimum of 34 seconds to complete. Therefore, the average experience per hour will be around 8,000-9,250, depending on the player's concentration.

===Shayzien Agility Course===
{{main|Shayzien Agility Course}}
[[File:Shayzien helm (5) detail.png|right|100x100px]]
The Shayzien Agility Course is split into two Basic and Advanced course, with the former requiring 5 Agility and the latter requiring 48 Agility.
The basic course takes around 53 seconds to complete, yields 133.2 experience, with it also being very unlikely to fail any of the course's obstacles, making the average Agility experience per hour 8,750. 
The advanced course takes around 49 seconds and yields 474.3 experience, making the average Agility experience per hour around 28,000.

===Penguin Agility Course===
{{Main|Penguin Agility Course}}
[[File:Clockwork suit detail.png|right|100x100px]]
This Agility course requires level 30 Agility and is located on the [[Iceberg]], which requires completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Cold War]] to access. To get to the course, players need to transform into a penguin, which can be done by talking to [[Larry]] with a [[clockwork suit]] in the inventory and choosing the ''Tuxedo time'' option.

Due to the success rate of the obstacles, the experience rates scale with the player's Agility level. At higher levels expect to be able to complete around 55 laps per hour, resulting in 29,500-30,000 Agility experience per hour.

This course has the highest base chance to receive the [[giant squirrel]]. At level 99 Agility, it would take an average of 130 hours to get the giant squirrel.

===Barbarian Outpost Agility Course===
{{Main|Barbarian Outpost Agility Course}}
The Barbarian Outpost Agility Course requires level 35 Agility and completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Alfred Grimhand's Barcrawl]] to access. This course is a lap-based obstacle course consisting of eight obstacles that players can traverse in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

With an average time of 32 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 17,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 11,000-14,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

===Ape Atoll Agility Course===
{{Main|Ape Atoll Agility Course}}
[[File:Monkey Archer.png|right|100x100px]]
The Ape Atoll Agility Course requires level 48 Agility and completion of Chapter 2 of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Monkey Madness I]] to access. To train at this course, players need to transform into a monkey, which can be done by equipping a [[Monkey greegree (small ninja)|Ninja monkey greegree]] or [[Kruk monkey greegree]]. This course is a lap-based obstacle course consisting of six obstacles that players can traverse in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

With an average time of 39 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 53,300 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 40,000-50,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

===Wilderness Agility Course===
{{Main|Wilderness Agility Course}}
The Wilderness Agility Course requires level 52 Agility to access. However, this level is only needed to access the course through the gates; the minimum level requirement of the obstacles is level 49. Therefore, it is a popular method to access this course by using a [[temporary skill boost]] to access the course starting at level 47, since the experience per hour at this course is far superior to other courses available to these players. The Agility course consists of five obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. If all obstacles are passed in the correct order, some bonus experience is rewarded at the end of the lap.

Since this Agility course is located deep in the [[Wilderness]], ranging from level 50 to 56, is it possible to come across [[Player killing|player killers]] while training there. Additionally, there are two level 25 [[skeleton]]s roaming the Agility course that will attack any player near them.

With an average time of 40 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 47,500 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 40,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

===Werewolf Agility Course===
{{Main|Werewolf Agility Course}}
[[File:Stick (item) detail.png|right|100px]]
The Werewolf Agility Course requires level 60 Agility and completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Creature of Fenkenstrain]] to access. To get to the course, players need to be wearing a [[ring of charos]]. The Agility course consists of five obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. If the [[Stick (item)|stick]] is collected and turned in at the end of the lap, some bonus experience is rewarded. The only failable obstacle on this course is the notorious deathslide, which can hit over 30 damage.

This course offers the highest potential experience per hour rates of all Agility courses. However, it requires a lot more concentration than other courses offering pretty similar experience rates.

With an average time of 38 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 69,500 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

===Prifddinas Agility Course===
{{Main|Prifddinas Agility Course}}
[[File:Crystal shard detail.png|right|100x100px]]
The Prifddinas Agility Course requires level 75 Agility and completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Song of the Elves]] to access. The Agility course consists of twelve obstacles that players can pass in return for Agility experience. This Agility course is unique to other courses; in that, portals can appear at various points throughout the course. Entering these portals will teleport the player one or two obstacles further, slightly decreasing the time needed to complete the course and thus increasing the experience per hour rate. Additionally, approximately 15 [[crystal shard]]s can be found per hour by entering these portals yielding up to {{Coins|({{GEP|Divine super combat potion(4)}}-{{GEP|Super combat potion(4)}})/0.4*15}} if making [[Divine super combat potion|Divine super combat potions]] with 97 [[Herblore]].

With an average time of 72 seconds per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 66,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

==Rooftop Agility courses==
{{Main|Rooftop Agility Courses}}
[[File:Mark of grace detail.png|right|100px]]
Rooftop Agility Courses were introduced to ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' on [[5 December]] [[2013]]. A total of nine courses have been released.

The rooftop Agility courses will provide the player with [[Mark of grace|marks of grace]], which can be used to buy the [[graceful outfit]] and [[amylase pack]]s from [[Grace]].

Chances of obtaining marks of grace are reduced to 20% of the normal rate if the player's Agility level is 20 levels higher than the course requirement.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/628223083858362368|date=3 August 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/r7dFR|archivedate=25 May 2020|quote=If your unboosted level is 20 higher than required for the course, the rate is reduced to 20% of its normal rate.}} Until the player reaches that level, marks of grace will continue to spawn normally.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/628523773856219136|date=4 August 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/USw7i|archivedate=25 May 2020|quote=The nerfage does not increase gradually. Unless you get to level 110, Ardougne isn't nerfed.}}

{{:Rooftop Agility Courses}}

==Other courses==
These courses consist of something else than just completing a circuit of obstacles.

===Brimhaven Agility Arena===
{{Main|Brimhaven Agility Arena}}
[[File:Agility arena ticket detail.png|right|100px]]
The Brimhaven Agility Arena is very different to other Agility courses. Instead of running laps around obstacle courses, the Brimhaven Agility Arena sets players the objective to tag Ticket Dispensers for [[agility arena ticket]]s.
The Brimhaven Agility Arena consists of 25 pillars, with adjacent pillars being connected via Agility obstacles. 24 of these pillars contain a ticket dispenser. Every minute, one of these ticket dispensers will be activated, and the player should try to find their way to this activated dispenser by traversing the Agility obstacles as quickly as possible. When first tagging a ticket dispenser, no ticket will be rewarded. For every subsequently tagged ticket dispenser, one ticket will be reward. If not tagging a ticket dispenser in time, the next tagged dispenser will not result in a ticket.

The tickets can be traded in to [[Pirate Jackie the Fruit]] for Agility experience or a selection of items.

The best experience per hour rates will be achieved by non-stop completing Agility obstacles during the waiting time for the active ticket dispenser to move, making it possible to achieve experience rates upwards of 67,000 Agility experience per hour at level 99 Agility. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 50,000-60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on Agility and concentration levels.

===Agility Pyramid===
{{Main|Agility Pyramid}}
[[File:Pyramid top detail.png|right|100px]]
The [[Agility Pyramid]] is an Agility training area located in the [[Kharidian Desert]] available to players with level 30 Agility. On this course, players start at the bottom of a pyramid with the goal of reaching the top, where they are able to collect the [[pyramid top]]. Before reaching the top, players will have to successfully traverse each of the five layers of the pyramid. These layers are filled with obstacles however, forcing the player back to the previous layer upon failing to pass them.

Pyramid tops may be handed in to [[Simon Templeton]] in exchange for {{Coins|10,000}}.

Level 75 Agility or higher will prevent the player from failing any of the obstacles, making it possible to complete a maximum of 26 laps per hour, which will reward a maximum of 44,700 experience per hour.

===Dorgesh-Kaan===
{{Main|Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course}}
[[File:Bullseye lantern (lit) detail.png|right|100px]]
The [[Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course]] is an Agility training area located in [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] available to players with level 70 Agility and completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Death to the Dorgeshuun]]. The basic premise of the course is to cross obstacles using one of two routes to retrieve an item requested by [[Turgall]]. One route will focus on purely training Agility, while the other course will mainly reward [[Ranged]] experience.

With an average time of 2:36 minutes per lap, it is possible to get upwards of 63,000 Agility experience per hour from this course. At lower Agility levels, expect to get around 50,000-60,000 Agility experience per hour, depending on concentration levels.

While having very similar experience rates per hour to the [[Ardougne Rooftop Course]], the chance to get the [[giant squirrel]] pet is around 15% higher at the Dorgesh-Kaan Agility Course.

===Hallowed Sepulchre===
{{Main|Hallowed Sepulchre}}
[[File:Hallowed_symbol_detail.png|right|100px]]
The [[Hallowed Sepulchre]] is an Agility training area located in [[Darkmeyer]] available to players with 52 Agility and completion of {{SCP|Quest}} [[Sins of the Father]]. Once an ancient [[Saradominist]] burial ground, the Sepulchre consists of five floors, unlocked at 52, 62, 72, 82, and 92 agility. On each floor, players must actively navigate through obstacles and reach the end before a timer expires. On each floor, the player can choose to loot coffins and receive [[Hallowed marks]], or to continue without looting and achieve higher experience rates. 

The sepulchre is a very high intensity training method, but has the potential to reward high rates of experience and gold per hour, especially at high Agility levels&lt;!-- add exact rates when known --&gt;. It is also the only way to obtain the Dark [[graceful outfit]] recolour and the [[dark acorn]].

==Other training methods==
===Blast Furnace===
{{Main|Blast Furnace}}

The multiplayer Blast Furnace minigame has a facility to operate a belt to transport ores into the furnace. This rewards 1 Agility experience per [[RuneScape clock|game tick]], for a maximum of 6,000 experience per hour. This task, however, quickly drains your run energy, so it may be difficult to reach those experience rates.

===Gnome Ball===
{{Main|Gnome Ball}}

Gnome Ball is a small members only minigame in which one or more players aim to score goals against gnomes. This is done by throwing the gnome ball into the goal. [[Ranged]] experience is gained each time the ball is thrown, while both Ranged and Agility experience are rewarded when a goal is scored. When you enter the field, you should talk to the referee to get the rules, and how to play.

===Toy mouse===
A [[toy mouse]] can be made on a [[Crafting table]] in a [[player-owned house]], or rarely attracted while wearing an [[Ava's accumulator]]. Winding, releasing and catching it will reward 3 Agility experience each time.

===Underwater Agility and Thieving===
{{Main|Underwater Agility and Thieving}}
The [[Underwater Agility and Thieving]] activity is a skilling method that combines the Agility and [[Thieving]] skill. This activity is located in the [[Underwater]] area of [[Fossil Island]].

In this activity, players swim around looking for opened [[Chest (underwater)|treasure chests]] and [[Clam|giant clam shells]]. Searching these chests and clams will reward the player with [[mermaid's tear]]s and [[glistening tear]]s, which can be exchanged for several items and Agility and/or Thieving experience respectively.

The experience rates scale quadratically with the player's Agility and Thieving levels; therefore, it is not recommended to do this method at lower levels. At level 99 in both skills, the estimated experience per hour is 38,800 Agility and 142,300 Thieving experience per hour.

===Werewolf Skullball===
{{Main|Werewolf Skullball}}
Skullball is played in the Werewolf agility area east of [[Canifis]]. Level 25 Agility and a [[ring of charos]] are required to access this activity.

To play, talk to the [[Skullball boss]] at the start of the course. From there, the challenge is to kick the ball through a course of 10 obstacles and score a goal. To kick the ball, right click on it and select how far to kick it. A tap advances the ball 1 space, a kick is 5 spaces, and shoot is 10 spaces. There is also an option of having the map highlighting the goal.

When successfully completing the course, an experience reward will be received, based on the completion time of the course. If it's under 4 minutes, a maximum of 750 experience will be rewarded. Any more and the experience becomes less.

===Wintertodt Pillars===
From level 60 Agility onwards, it is possible to train Agility by repeatedly using the gap-jump [[shortcut]] in the [[Wintertodt]]'s prison. Each jump gives 18 experience, making it a good way to get a bit of Agility experience while waiting for the Wintertodt to spawn. If focusing solely on training Agility here, the player can expect experience rates of up to 21,000 Agility experience per hour. Keep in mind that the Wintertodt is a dangerous boss, so it is recommended to bring multiple pieces of [[Wintertodt/Warm clothing|warm clothing]] and sufficient [[food]].

==Shortcuts==
{{Main|Shortcuts}}

Shortcuts are identified with a curved green arrow icon [[File:Agility shortcut icon.png]] on the [[minimap]].

===Other===
There are additional Agility obstacles that are not identified on the world map with a [[File:Agility shortcut icon.png]] shortcut icon or part of an Agility course.

==Run energy restoration==
{{Main|Energy}}

The amount of restored [[run energy]] per minute depends on the player's Agility level. The rate of run energy restoration can be boosted by partial bonuses provided by individual [[Graceful outfit|graceful]] items, including as much as 30% if the complete [[graceful outfit]] is unlocked and worn. Contrary to popular belief, a player's Agility level does not affect how quickly the player's run energy is depleted, which is instead affected by the player's [[weight]], the effects of [[stamina potion]]s, and the passive effect of the [[ring of endurance]].

The table below presents the time it takes to restore 1% of run energy.

Players will gain E amount of run energy per second where A is the player's agility level.

&lt;math&gt;
E(A) = \frac{\lfloor\frac{A}{6}\rfloor + 8}{60}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Artisan''' was a proposed [[skill]] developed and polled over the course of [[2014]]. Often described as "slayer for skilling", Artisan would have tasked players with gathering and crafting specific items depending on assignments given out by Artisan masters.

The skill was proposed and developed over the course of four developer blogs:
*[[13 June]] [[2014]] - '''{{UD|Developer Blog: Artisan Skill}}'''
*[[20 June]] [[2014]] - '''{{UD|Artisan revisited}}'''
*[[10 July]] [[2014]] - '''{{UD|Dev Blog: Artisan}}'''
*[[15 August]] [[2014]] - '''{{UD|Artisan - The Final Developer Blog}}'''

The skill was polled to be added to the game in two separate polls:
*[[17 July]] [[2014]] - '''[[Poll:Old School feature poll - Artisan and Bounty Hunter]]''' - Artisan fails with 58.9% support
*[[21 August]] [[2014]] - '''[[Poll:Old School feature poll - Artisan Skill]]''' - Artisan fails with 56.5% support. Many pieces of content that Artisan would have added were also polled as separate additions to the game; none passed the 75% mark. However, Redwood Trees almost passed and were nevertheless added to the game, and Quartz was an inspiration for [[Amethyst]] which was also added.

==Mechanics==
Much like the [[Slayer]] [[skill]] that inspired it, to train Artisan a player would have started by talking to an Artisan master. The master would have given the player an assignment to either gather resources or craft resources into new items. Doing those assignments would have earned Artisan [[experience]] along with the experience the assigned activity would usually give.

===Artisan Masters===
Much like [[Slayer master]]s, Artisan would have had a number of NPCs in charge of giving the player various assignments in order to train the skill. Five Artisan masters were planned, each focusing on a different level range and assignment difficulty. The proposed level ranges were: 1-29, 30-49, 50-64, 65-74, and 75+.

Each Artisan master would have also granted access to a new resource area, containing unique new resources alongside regular resources.

===Gathering Resources===
With a "gathering assignment", the Artisan master would have told a player to collect a specific resource through skills such as [[Mining]], [[Woodcutting]], [[Fishing]], or [[Hunter]]. Artisan experience would have been rewarded at the end of the assignment, when the player returned to the master. The proposed items to gather, divided by master, were as follows. Items in '''bold''' were new additions, unique to the Artisan skill.

Alongside many familiar resources, these proposed assigments also included a number of new resources, to be added alongside the Artisan skill. The skill requirements for these new additions were as follows:

===Using Resources===
[[File:Artisan - The Final Developer Blog (4).jpg|right|200px|thumb|Concept art of an Artisan workshop.]]
Having collected the items in the "gathering assignment", the player would then have the option to ask the Artisan master for a "crafting assignment". This assignment would use the resources the player had gathered to create new items. For example, a gathering assignment for [[pure essence]] might be followed by a crafting assignment to craft the essence into new runes. Completing a crafting assignment would have rewarded experience in both Artisan and the other skill(s) used to create the new item.

Crafting assigments would have been completed in specific "Artisan workshops", associated with the various Artisan masters. With the proper Artisan level, the player would gain access to the masters' workshops, allowing them to complete the crafting assignments. Alternatively, the player could use [[Construction]] to create their own Artisan workshop in their [[Player-owned house]].

===Artisan Points===
Much like the [[Slayer reward point]] system, completing Artisan assignments would have rewarded the player with "Artisan points" with various uses. Artisan points were proposed to have the following uses:
*Block assignments for a specific skill for the next 10 levels. (A maximum of three skills can be blocked in total)
*Block assignments for a specific skill until you unblock them. (A maximum of three skills can be blocked in total)
*Unblock a specific skill.
*Block a specific assignment. (up to a maximum of 5 assignments blocked)
*Unblock a specific assignment
*Be able to increase the amount of items you need to collect or craft in an assignment.
*Ability to unlock specific non Artisan crafting assignments such as unstrung long bows.
*Ability to unlock specific assignments so they can be crafted outside of assignments

==Features==
Artisan crafting assignments would have offered a number of new ways to create new items. Many of these crafting methods combined multiple skills, such as fish fillets using both [[Cooking]] and [[Herblore]] to create new food items.

===Fish fillets===
Fish fillets were a proposed type of food item that would use [[Cooking]] and [[Herblore]] to create food with special effects. The process would have used a raw [[fish]] and a [[herb]], with the resulting fillet healing as much as the cooked fish and giving a chance for a potion-like boost depending on the herb used. For example, a fillet made with a [[raw shark]] and a [[toadflax]] would heal 20 hitpoints like a regular [[shark]], and also give a chance to temporarily boost the player's [[Agility]] level by 2 (similar to the [[Agility potion]], which Toadflax is an ingredient in). The proposed effects of each herb, along with the Artisan and Herblore levels required to use them in a fillet, were as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-left-3 align-left-5" style="text-align:center;"

===Carvings===
Carvings were proposed [[neck slot]] items that would have been made using [[Crafting]]. They would have been carved out of [[ore]], and when worn, would have given a chance of mining an extra ore from the next 28 rocks mined of that ore type. Each carving had proposed Artisan and Crafting levels required to make them, as well as a required [[Mining]] level to use it, as follows:

===Artisan tools===
Artisan tools would have been a collection of crafting tools with extra functionality or features, created through the Artisan skill. The tools would have been tradeable, but could only be made while on a specific assignment to do so (with the exception of the Artisan's pickaxe and hatchet).

===Totems===
Totems were proposed as a combination of [[Crafting]], [[Woodcutting]], and [[Firemaking]]. An assignment to create a totem would have involved crafting it out of various logs, with the amount of logs required dependent on their quality. Burning the totem would have given a temporary beneficial effect. The various proposed totems as well as the Artisan, Crafting, and Firemaking levels required to make and use them are as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-left-2 align-left-5" style="text-align:center;"

===Two handed Crossbows===
[[File:Dev Blog- Artisan (13).jpg|right|200px|thumb|Concept art of a two handed crossbow.]]
Two handed crossbows were proposed as a potential [[Fletching]] crafting assignment. They would have been slower, more powerful alternatives to regular crossbows, and would have had a [[Strength]] level requirement to use them. The proposed two handed crossbows were as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-left-2 align-left-5" style="text-align:center;"

===Slow burners===
Slow burners were a proposed combination of [[Firemaking]] and [[Herblore]], which would have used ground up [[Coal]] added to various logs to creater longer-lasting [[fire]]s with a lower chance of burning food. Higher tiers of slow burners would have required more finely ground coal powder, with more coal needed for better logs. The different tiers of slow burners, along with the levels and amount of coal necessary to make them, were proposed as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-left-2" style="text-align:center;"

===Combining Runes===
[[File:Dev Blog- Artisan (2).png|right|200px|thumb|Concept art of a Doom rune, a proposed combination of a Chaos rune and a Death rune.]]
A number of Artisan-specific [[combination runes]] were proposed as an addition to the [[Runecraft]] skill. These would have had the functionality of two or more types of runes in a single inventory spot, much like how existing elemental combination runes (such as [[Dust rune]]s) combine two elemental runes into one. These runes would have been crafted at a specific "Artisan Runecraft altar". The proposed runes, as well as the Artisan level, Runecraft level, and [[Pure essence]] needed to make them, were as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-left-2 align-left-5" style="text-align:center;"
!Artisan&lt;br/&gt;Level

|24
|Each rune counts as one [[Law rune]], five [[Air rune]]s, and two of the other elemental runes. ([[Water rune|Water]], [[Earth rune|Earth]], [[Fire rune|Fire]])
|}

===Construction shortcuts===
Artisan would have provided a way to make [[shortcuts]] around the world with the [[Construction]] skill. These shortcuts would have degraded over time, with their durability tied to the quality of materials used to build them. The proposed shortcuts along with the requirements to make them were as follows:

===Skilling bracelets===
Skilling bracelets were proposed as degradeable skilling [[jewellery]], which would give bonuses to gathering skills such as [[Fishing]] and [[Mining]]. Each bracelet would have had a [[Crafting]] level requirement to make, as well as a specific skill requirement to equip depending on the type of bracelet. The proposed skilling bracelets were as follows:

|{{SCP|Woodcutting|50}}
|}

===Quartz figurines===
With the new mining resource of quartz, Artisan also would have added quartz figurines as [[Construction]] items. When placed in a [[player-owned house]], quartz figurines would have given a chance to build an item without using resources. The proposed quartz figurines were as follows:

{|class="wikitable align-center-1 align-center-3"

|}

===Clothing===
Artisan would have added a number of new clothing items with unique effects, along with new [[Farming]] crops to get the materials to make them. Spinning the crops into ingredients to use in making the clothing would have rewarded [[Crafting]] experience. The proposed new crops were as follows:

These new materials, along with existing clothing materials such as furs from [[Hunter]], would have been used to make new clothing items with the Artisan skill. Unlike most other new Artisan items, making clothing would not have required the player to be on a specific Artisan assignment to do so. The proposed new clothing items and their effects were as follows:

==Legacy==
Though Artisan failed to pass a poll, its influences can be seen in many parts of the game today. Over the years, a number of features originally proposed as parts of Artisan have been added to the game or otherwise polled as parts of different proposed updates.
*[[Redwood|Redwood tree]]s and [[redwood logs|logs]] were added to the game alongside the [[Woodcutting Guild]] in [[Update:The Woodcutting Guild|an update]] on [[2 June]] [[2016]]. Originally proposed with Artisan as a level 85 [[Woodcutting]] tree, the Redwood trees were [[Poll:Old School Content Poll 43: Great Kourend Content|re-polled]] as level 90 Woodcutting trees on [[13 May]] [[2016]] and passed with 87.6% support.
*With {{UD|The Kebos Lowlands}} update came the [[pearl fishing rod]], [[pearl fly fishing rod]], and [[pearl barbarian rod]]. These wieldable rods are reminiscent of the "Expert's fishing rod" and "Expert's fly fishing rod" proposed with Artisan.
*The [[light ballista|light]] and [[heavy ballista]]e added with {{UD|Monkey Madness II}} are reminiscent of Artisan's proposed two-handed crossbows. Though not identical in function, both concepts fit the niche of a slow, two-handed ranged weapon with a higher max hit than its one-handed counterparts.
*Many of the ideas proposed with Artisan's clothing-making appeared as part of the proposed skill [[Warding]], which also failed to pass a [[poll]]. In particular, the process of farming plants to make cloth and using that cloth to craft clothing with [[Magic]] bonuses is very similar between both proposed skills.

==Trivia==
* The original concept for Artisan was a piece of Player Designed Content suggested by a user named ''Pix869''.{{CiteNews|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/developer-blog-artisan-skill?oldschool=1|title=Developer Blog: Artisan Skill|newsdate=13 June 2014|quote=A few weeks ago the artisan skill blew away all competition to win the latest PDC competition with a whopping 49% of the vote. The original concept, which was designed by Pix869, was very strong and we have worked with that design to flesh out the concept further.}}

'''Attack''' is a player's accuracy in [[melee]] [[combat]]. As a player raises their Attack level, they can deal damage more consistently as well as wield [[weapons]] of stronger materials.

==Fighting accurately==
In order to gain [[experience]] in the Attack stat, players must choose the ''accurate'' [[attack style]]. While using the style, players gain an invisible +3 attack bonus. Attack is [[Damage_per_second/Melee#Step_six:_Calculate_the_hit_chance|used to calculate the accuracy of your attacks]] against an enemy's defence.

==Attack bonuses==
Some [[weapons]] give players ''Attack bonuses'' when using certain [[attack types]]. These bonuses are noted in the [[Equipment Stats]] section of the equipment menu. Attack bonuses give players advantages as well as disadvantages in [[melee]] [[combat]], based on their target's strengths and weaknesses.

|}

===Other Attack bonuses===

*An [[amulet of power]] gives an equipment bonus of +6 to the stab, slash, and crush Attack types.
*An [[amulet of glory]] gives an equipment bonus of +10 to the stab, slash and crush Attack types.
*The [[beads of the dead]] gives +1 in all styles.
*An [[amulet of fury]] gives the same bonuses as the [[amulet of glory]] in the Attack stats, but has higher bonuses in [[Defence]], [[Strength]], and [[Prayer]].
*The [[amulet of torture]] gives +15 to all melee attack bonuses.
*A [[Warrior ring]] gives an equipment bonus of +4 to just the slash Attack bonus.
*Any gloves received as a reward from the [[Culinaromancer]]'s Chest as a reward from the [[Recipe for Disaster]] quest gives substantial attack bonuses in stab, slash and crush; the more expensive, the better the bonuses.
**"Bronze" gloves provide equipment bonuses of +2 in each melee style.
**"Iron" gloves provide equipment bonuses of +3 in each melee style.
**"Steel" gloves provide equipment bonuses of +4 in each melee style.
**"Black" gloves provide equipment bonuses of +5 in each melee style.

[[File:Construction icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Construction''' is a [[Members|members-only]] [[Skills|skill]] that allows players to build [[Player-owned house|their own houses]] and provide furniture for them. To begin Construction, players must buy a house from one of the [[estate agent]]s. A starter house will cost {{Coins|1000}}, and will be in [[Rimmington]]. A level 40 [[Magic]] spell can then be used to teleport to the house, or players can walk to Rimmington, where there is a [[POH portal|portal]] ([[File:House portal icon.png]] [[icon]] on the [[World map|map]]) that will teleport players to their house.

The house starts off with only a [[parlour]] and [[garden]], but furniture and additional rooms can be built. To build, go to the [[options]] menu, select [[Options#House options|house options]], and set the [[building mode]] mode to on. Players will then see what looks like ghost-like [[hotspots]] where new objects can be built. See the [[Constructed items]] list for details on what you can build at what level.

Players can also visit a friend's house if they are home and using the same portal.

==How to start training construction==
&lt;tabber&gt;

1. Buying a house=

===Buying a house===
The first step in training the construction skill is buying a [[player-owned house]]. A house costs 1,000 [[coins]] and can be bought by talking to an [[estate agent]].
Alternatively players can complete the [[miniquest]] [[Daddy's Home]] earning a house as a reward.

====Estate agent====
[[Estate agent]]s are [[Non-player character|NPCs]] that sell [[player]]s land to build their house on. These agents can be found in several major cities: [[Varrock]], [[Falador]], [[Seers' Village]], [[East Ardougne]], and [[Hosidius]]. They are identified on the [[minimap]] by a symbol of a small house ([[File:Estate Agent icon.png]]). Players must pay 1,000 [[coins]] to purchase their first house in [[Rimmington]], and begin training the Construction skill.

After reaching certain level milestones between level 1 and 70, players can pay an estate agent to move or decorate their house. For more information on this subject, visit the [[estate agent]] page.

Estate agents also sell the [[Construct. cape|Construction cape]] for 99,000 coins to anyone with level 99 Construction.

|-|

2. Getting to your house=

[[File:Portal (Player-owned house).png|thumb|150x100px|A [[House portal]].]]
[[File:Teleport to house (tablet) detail.png|thumb|130x130px|A [[Teleport to house (tablet)|Teleport to house]] tablet.]]
===How to get to your house===
There are four ways to enter your player-owned house. The first option is by entering the [[POH portal]] that is connected to your house. The other options are by teleporting into your house.

====POH Locations====
The locations of [[POH portal]]s are identified by the portal [[File:House portal icon.png]] [[icon]] on the [[world map]].

When first bought, the player-owned house is located in [[Rimmington]]. Players can move their house to [[Rimmington]] ({{SCP|Construction|1}}), [[Taverley]] ({{SCP|Construction|10}}), [[Pollnivneach]] ({{SCP|Construction|20}}), [[Hosidius]] ({{SCP|Construction|25}}), [[Rellekka]] ({{SCP|Construction|30}}), [[Brimhaven]] ({{SCP|Construction|40}}), [[Yanille]] ({{SCP|Construction|50}}), or [[Prifddinas]] ({{SCP|Construction|70}}) by paying a small fee (5,000 to 50,000 coins) to an estate agent, assuming they meet the construction level requirement.

See the [[POH portal]] page for more information on the exact location of the POH portals and the (dis)advantages of each location.

====Teleports====
Players can teleport to their house by casting the [[Teleport to House]] spell, requiring level 40 Magic, or by breaking a [[teleport to house]] tablet. Players who are level 99 in Construction could also use their [[Construct. cape|Construction cape]] to teleport to their house.

|-|

3. Building in your house=

===How to build in your house===
After entering their house, players are able to start training Construction. To do so, first enter the [[building mode]]. While in the building mode, translucent [[hotspot]]s will appear indicating objects can be built here.

====Entering building mode====
There are two ways to enter the [[building mode]] of your house. The first option is to right-click the [[POH portal]] and selecting the 'build mode' option. The second option is by going to the [[Options]] menu in the main game [[interface]]. Once "House options" button is chosen, players can toggle Building mode ON and OFF.

While in this building mode, players can purchase extra rooms or build furniture.

====Adding new rooms====
There are many different rooms that can be added to houses. The house a player buys will begin with a [[garden]] and [[parlour]], but more rooms can be added. Different rooms will require different Construction levels (ranging from level 1 to 80) and will cost money (ranging from 1,000 to 250,000 coins). New rooms can be added by right-clicking the [[door hotspot]]s or using the [[Options#House options|viewer]] while in [[building mode]].

See the [[Player-owned house#Rooms|player-owned house]] page for more information on the exact level requirement and the cost of each room.

====Building furniture====
Each room has a wide and unique variety of objects that can be built in them. The locations for these objects are indicated by their [[hotspot]]s while in [[building mode]]. In order to build an object, right-click the [[hotspot]] to open the Furniture Creation Menu and choose one of the available options.

The Furniture Creation Menu will show the Construction level requirement and the materials needed for all objects that can be build in that [[hotspot]].

Besides having the Construction level and material requirements, players will also need to carry a [[hammer]] and [[saw]] in their inventory in order to build most objects. A filled [[watering can]] is needed to add plants to your gardens.

&lt;/tabber&gt;

==Materials==
There are multiple materials needed for constructing your house. Most furniture options contain one or more of these items that are often used in the Construction skill. When used in a piece of furniture, these items will reward the player with a set amount of Construction experience. (i.e. When constructing an object with [[oak plank]]s, this will always reward the player with 60 experience per plank.)

==Tips and tricks==
===Servants===
Servants can be hired at the [[Servants' Guild]], the very north-eastern building in [[Ardougne]]. There are five different [[servant]]s, which can perform various services. All servants are able to greet guests entering a players' home, but some will have different abilities, such as taking items to and from the [[bank]] or [[sawmill]]. The higher level servant a player has, the faster their service is, the better food they provide, and the more items they can carry to or from a bank or sawmill.

After using a servant's services seven times, the servant will ask the player to pay them. After using a servant's services eight times, the player is required to pay them or the servant will quit. A player can build a [[Servant's moneybag]] and put coins in it to automatically pay their servant.

A player must have at least two [[bedroom]]s with [[Bedroom#Bed|beds]] in them in order to hire a servant. A player may only have one servant at a time; if a player wants to hire a new servant, they must fire their current one first.

[[File:Phials.png|window|right|120x120px|Phials]]

===Phials for unnoting===
[[Phials]] is an [[Non-player character|NPC]] located next to the [[Rimmington General Store]] in [[Rimmington]] who will un-note [[items]] for 5 [[coins]] per item.

Phials is commonly used by players training Construction due to his proximity to the Rimmington [[POH portal|house portal]]. He is also useful for training [[Prayer]] on a [[gilded altar]] in a [[player-owned house]].

==Training methods==

==Miscellaneous==
[[File:Construct. cape detail.png|thumb|120px|Construction cape]]
===Cape of accomplishment===
A [[Construct. cape|Construction cape]] is the [[Cape of Accomplishment]] for the Construction skill. It can be purchased for 99,000 coins alongside the [[Construct. hood]] from any [[Estate agent]] by players who have achieved skill mastery (level 99) in the Construction skill.

When the Construction cape is equipped or in the inventory, it provides unlimited teleports to the player's own [[player-owned house|house]] and to the house portals located in [[Rimmington]], [[Taverley]], [[Pollnivneach]], [[Hosidius]], [[Rellekka]], [[Brimhaven]], [[Yanille]], and [[Prifddinas]].

===STASH units===
[[STASH|STASH units]] (short for "Store Things And Stuff Here"), also known as hidey holes, are storage units for [[emote clue]] items, saving [[bank]] space and bank trips for players who do [[Treasure Trails]] frequently.

There are 103 STASH units in total found throughout Gielinor. These locations are initially labelled as inconspicuous bushes/crates/holes/rocks, and, once built, become usable STASH units. Players can check which units they've already built/filled by visiting Watson and reading the noticeboard within his house, or reading the chart in their PoH [[study]] after it's been built.

The materials and level required to build these inconspicuous objects into STASH units depend on the tier of clue scroll they relate to. A [[hammer]] and a [[saw]] are required to build STASH units. All 10 nails must be made of the same metal.

*The house shown in the cutscene when entering a [[Player-owned house]] was taken from issue 24 of the God Letters: [[Transcript:Guthix Ponders|Guthix Ponders]], dating back to [[22 September]] [[2004]]. Its file name was "prettyhouse.jpg".
*The [[watch]], [[sextant]] and [[chart]] cannot be used in your house, trying to use it will give the message: "The sextant doesn't seem to work here".
*In ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', there was briefly a skill that had no use called Carpentry. The modern skill of Construction was an updated version of this unused skill.

[[File:Cooking icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Cooking''' is a [[skill]] that allows raw [[food]] to be made edible, healing [[hitpoints]] when eaten. To do this, the player uses a raw, cookable food on a [[range]] or [[fire]].

Depending on the player's Cooking level, food will sometimes burn, becoming unusable. Ranges burn food less often than fires at the same level, and some foods can only be cooked on ranges. Some ranges, such as the [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|one]] in the [[Lumbridge Castle]] or in the [[Hosidius Kitchen]], burn food less often than a normal range.

Cooking goes hand-in-hand with the [[Fishing]] skill as the player can cook the fish they obtain. If no range is nearby, having an [[axe]] and [[tinderbox]] on hand can allow the player to cut down a tree and make a fire to cook the fish on.

By levelling Cooking, the player is able to cook better foods such as [[swordfish]], [[shark]], [[pies]], and [[pizza]]s. If a player achieves 32 cooking, they can access the [[Cooks' Guild|Cook's Guild]] near the Grand Exchange.

==How to cook==
Cooking is known as one of the fastest skills to train, as players can cook in many different ways as well as being able to simply buy their raw food items from the [[Grand Exchange]].

Before the Grand Exchange was created, the bulk of players usually fished and then cooked their catches. Generally a player who is manually gathering their raw items will cook their food items on a local [[Fire|campfire]] created through the [[Firemaking]] skill near where they are gathering, or take the items they have obtained to a [[range]] and cook there.

Ranges (which provide a lower burn rate) can be easily located and are almost always well labelled on the [[World map|map]] as a cooking pan ([[File:Cooking range icon.png|The cooking range icon on the map]]) [[icon]]. There are other assorted things that a player can cook on, seen in NPC camps, or on [[iron spit]]s. It is important to note that only meat, [[fish]] and [[stew]] can be cooked on an open fire. Foods like [[bread]], [[cake]], and [[pie]] must be cooked on a proper range, Most of these food items will generate an error message if the player attempts to cook it improperly while others, such as raw potatoes, will simply all burn. Raw foods loosely related to the [[Hunter]] skill, such as [[raw beast meat]], [[raw chompy]], and [[raw rabbit meat|rabbit]], must be cooked on an iron spit.

To actually cook something, players have to "use" their raw food item on a range or a campfire. If they have more than one food item of the same kind in their inventory, a picture of the food item will appear in the dialogue box. Ranges can also be left-clicked to automatically bring up this interface. The player can right-click on the picture and select how many they want to cook, or left click to cook all of them (default option).

If this is your first time cooking follow these steps for maximum effect:

* Cook on the [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|Lumbridge Castle range]] after completion of [[Cook's Assistant]], as there is a bank directly upstairs and the range offers a lower burn rate than other ranges.
* Cooking at the [[Rogues' Den]] has a permanent fire and is directly next to a banker ''([[members]] only)''.
* If you do not want to spend much money in this skill, you can kill [[cow]]s and cook the raw meat on the range or a fire.

==Burning food==
{{main|Burnt food}}
As players train Cooking, they will sometimes fail to cook something at random, resulting in no Cooking experience gained. It is normal when you first begin training this skill to burn nearly anything you cook on a fire or range, but as you gain more levels the burn ratio of food decreases until you reach a level where you can no longer burn them.

A table of the levels where cooking food items becomes successful 100% of the time can be found [[Cooking/Burn level|here]].

A useful item to equip while training are [[cooking gauntlets]]. Wearing these gloves while training Cooking will cut down time and money due to less food being burnt. This is useful for food such as [[shark]]s where even at 99 you have the chance to burn them; with the cooking gauntlets equipped, you will stop burning sharks at level 94. Alternatively, cooking food while wearing a [[cooking cape]] will ensure that no food may be burned by the player.

All [[range]]s have a lower burn rate than [[Fire|fires]], but there are also special ranges which offer decreased burn rates. These can work in conjunction with the cooking gauntlets. Unless the player is cooking something with 100% success rate, it is recommended to use these where possible to decrease the amount of burnt food. The recommended range to cook on for members is in the [[Hosidius Kitchen]], usable after gaining 100% [[Hosidius favour]]. This range grants a 5% increased chance to successfully cook food (10% if elite [[Kourend &amp; Kebos Diary|Kourend and Kebos diary]] completed) and is very close to a bank chest.

The [[Cooking range (Lumbridge Castle)|range]] in Lumbridge Castle also has a lower burn rate for some foods, usable after completing the [[Cook's Assistant]] quest. The nearest bank to this range (for members) is the [[Culinaromancer's Chest]] in the cellar, which requires the first part of the [[Recipe for Disaster]] quest to be completed, or the bank at the top of [[Lumbridge Castle]] for free players.

==Items needed==
As Cooking is the skill of turning food from raw to edible, and there is a very wide range of available food types in ''RuneScape'', there are many items that players need in order to cook food. Depending on what you are cooking, you will need a variety of items such as water or flour. Listed below are the cardinal cooking items which are used to make the most common types of food.

* [[Fish]] ([[raw lobster]], [[raw trout]], etc.)
* [[Flour]] (held in a [[pot]])
* [[Water]] (Held in a [[bucket]], [[bowl]], [[vial]] or [[jug]])
* [[Milk]] (held in a bucket)
* [[Meat]] ([[raw meat]], [[raw rat meat]], [[raw bear meat]], [[raw yak meat]], [[raw chicken]])
* Vegetables ([[cabbage]]s, [[grain]], [[onion]]s, [[potato]]es)
* Fruits ([[cooking apple]]s, [[grapes]], [[banana]]s, [[redberries]], [[tomato]]es)
* [[Cheese]]
* [[Bowl]]
* [[Bucket]]
* [[Cake tin]]
* [[Jug]]
* [[Pie dish]]
* [[Pot]]
* [[Knife]]

Note that every wine made resets the twelve second fermentation of the previously made wines, resulting in an enormous experience drop if a series of inventories are made fast enough. While being one of the fastest methods for reaching 99 Cooking (yielding 400k+ exp/hour if done optimally), it is also the most costly. There is virtually no profit made as opposed to the more traditional fish cooking. This method is also accessible to free-to-play.

==Brewing==
[[File:Brewing vat.png|thumb|200px|A brewing vat used to create ales.]]
{{main|Brewing}}
Brewing involves the fermenting of raw ingredients into [[ale]]s or [[cider]]. [[Brewing]] is useful because most products [[boost]] certain [[skill]]s. The process, however, is quite slow and is not a viable means of training. These [[alcohol]]ic [[drink]]s are not useful for healing, unlike most [[food]] made with Cooking. Brewing takes place at two [[fermenting vat]]s, one is located in eastern [[Keldagrim]], on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the [[Laughing Miner Pub]] and the other is located in [[Port Phasmatys]] underneath the [[The Green Ghost]] pub. Only one brew can be made in a vat at a time.

During the brewing process it is possible for an ale to mature, normally a 5% chance, or 64% when adding [[the stuff]]. The stuff '''cannot''' be added to cider. Mature ales have stronger [[boost]]s. It can also turn into bad ale which has no use and is drained from the barrel.

To make an ale, 2 [[bucket of water]], 2 [[barley malt]], 1 [[ale yeast]], and optionally: 1 [[the stuff]] are required:
{{Instructions
|step1 = Use 2 [[bucket of water]] on the [[fermenting vat]]
|step2 = Use 2 [[barley malt]] on the fermenting vat
|step3 = ''Optional:'' Use 1 [[the stuff]] on the fermenting vat, increasing the chance to mature the ale from 5% to 64%
|step4 = Use the ingredients specific to the brew type you want to make
|step5 = Use 1 [[ale yeast]] on the fermenting vat
|step6 = Wait for 3 x 640 minute cycles (with the stuff added, between 3 x 640 and 16 x 640 minutes)
|step7 = Use the valve to drain the completed ale into the barrel
|step8 = Use 8 [[beer glass]]es or 2 [[calquat keg]]s on the barrel full of the completed ale
}}

To make cider, 4 buckets of [[apple mush]], 1 [[ale yeast]] are required:
{{Instructions
|step1 = Use 4 buckets of [[apple mush]] on the [[fermenting vat]]
|step2 = Use 1 [[ale yeast]] on the fermenting vat
|step3 = Wait for three 640 minutes farming cycles
|step6 = Use the valve to drain the completed ale into the barrel
|step7 = Use 8 [[beer glass]]es or 2 [[calquat keg]]s on the barrel full of the completed cider
}}
Each apple mush requires 4 [[cooking apple]]s and one [[bucket]] added into the [[Apple Press]]. 16 cooking apples are required per cider.

Most brews boost certain stats, some boost a variable amount based on the skill's level, boosting more as the level increases.

==Gnome cooking==
{{main|Gnome cooking}}
Gnome cooking is very complicated, and is best left with its own specially dedicated guide. The gnome foods plays a big part in the [[Gnome Restaurant]] minigame. More detailed information can be found in article linked to above, but following is a general guide for how a player can get acquainted with gnome cooking.

Although it is complex, somewhat expensive, and requires a wide variety of unusual ingredients, gnome cooking can provide a good way to level Cooking from around 10 up to about 30 in good speed. To obtain the cookbook with all the recipes for gnome foods, a player can go to [[The Grand Tree]] in the [[Gnome Stronghold]] and find [[Aluft Gianne Sr]]. He is on the west side of the first level up of the Grand Tree and is dressed as a chef. Talk with him, and offer your assistance to him. He will assign you a succession of dishes to prepare. Once you have prepared the dish to his satisfaction, he will ask you to make another, then another moving steadily up the assortment of gnome foods. If you are using this method to train your Cooking and get an assignment you do not have the correct level to prepare, then you simply need to train until you do. Use the shops and resources in the Gnome Stronghold to make more gnome foods if you wish, or cook other foods that you may have. For each dish, the player can buy supplies from the shop run by Hudo who is found by the cooking range nearby Gianne, but ever since the shop stock update this has been severely limited. Players going through the tutorial will start by making crunchies, which can stored at a bank in the Grand Tree and later sold on the [[Grand Exchange]]. As your skill levels improve, you will be able to make battas then eventually bowls. Once you have completed the training exercises he gives you, you can start the minigame, which has several useful rewards.

==2-tick cooking==
[[File:Speed cooking.gif|thumb|2-tick cooking demonstrated at the range in [[Myths' Guild]].]]
It is possible to cook most foods at double speed, provided that they only have one cooking interface option. To perform this, drop the raw food items in front of a cooking range and then alternate between picking up raw food and left-clicking the range. This works because the cooking interface is skipped when only one raw food item is in the inventory, and the item is cooked with no delay. Due to the time it takes to drop items, the experience rate will not be exactly double, but this is still the fastest way to cook most foods.

Soft clay is obtained by [[mining]] [[clay]], then using it with an object containing [[water]], such as a [[bucket of water]] or a [[jug of water]].

==Armour==
===Leather===
[[File:Crafting Leather.gif|150px|thumb|A player crafts leather into a piece of leather armour.]]
To begin leather crafting, players need a [[needle]] and [[thread]], normally purchased from the [[Al Kharid]] or [[Rimmington]] [[Crafting shops]], and some [[cowhide]] tanned into [[leather]]. In a [[free-to-play]] world, this means visiting the tanner in Al Kharid until players are able to enter the guild. Tanning costs 1 [[coin]] per ordinary leather, 3 coins for [[hard leather]], and 20 coins for [[dragonhide]]. There is also a more expensive tannery available to [[Members]] in [[Canifis]].

The cattle field east of [[Lumbridge]] is a convenient spot for leather crafters and is easy to get to, but it is normally largely populated. Another convenient location to obtain cowhide in a free-to-play world is to the west of the [[Crafting Guild]], where there are many more [[cow]]s together in a smaller place, allowing faster kills. For Members, there is a field of cows north of [[Ardougne]] and west of the [[Legends' Guild]], which is fairly close to a [[bank]] and very rarely occupied by players.

'''Note:''' 1 spool of [[thread]] can make up to 5 pieces of [[leather armour]].

===Dragonhides===
This [[Members]]-only part of the Crafting [[skill]] is extremely similar to normal leather crafting, except that:
*{{Coins|20}} are paid to tan one piece of hide.
*Only vambraces, chaps, shields, and bodies can be made.
*[[High Level Alchemy]] is better cast on dragonhide bodies or vambraces rather than chaps, for their difference in coins received.
*Killing dragons for their hides is slow but profitable. Buying dragonhides is faster, though price is far higher than the high-alchemy value.
*Players may attach [[kebbit claws]] to any vambraces to make [[Spiky vambraces (disambiguation)|spiked vambraces]], giving them a +2 [[Strength]] bonus and granting 6 Crafting [[experience]].

===Snakeskin===
[[Snakeskin]]s are made by tanning [[Snake hide]]s, which can be found by killing [[bush snake]]s (on [[Mos Le'Harmless]]), [[Hoop Snake]]s (in the [[Tar Swamp]]), or on [[Karamja]] (during the [[Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup]] activity) or [[swamp snake]]s (during the [[Temple Trekking]] activity). They can be tanned for {{Coins|15}} each, and then crafted using a [[needle]] and [[thread]].

===Yak hide===
After starting [[The Fremennik Isles]] [[quest]], players can kill [[yak]]s to obtain [[yak-hide]]s and make them into [[Fremennik armour]] pieces. The yak hides need to be [[cured yak-hide|cured]] for {{Coins|5}} to become craftable. It is not advised to make bodies for [[experience]] because it costs an extra hide for the same return.

==Glass==
Glass making will require the following items:
*A [[glassblowing pipe]]. They can be obtained from various places, including [[Spawning|respawn]] points on [[Entrana]] and in [[Hemenster]] or the stores in [[Dorgesh-Kaan]] and the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]].
*[[Buckets of sand]]. There are [[sand pit]]s in [[Yanille]], [[Rellekka]], Dorgesh-Kaan, [[Zanaris]], [[Prifddinas]], and Entrana. Use an empty [[bucket]] with a sandpit to get a bucket of sand. If [[The Hand in the Sand]] [[quest]] has been completed, [[Bert]] can be asked to deliver 84 buckets of sand to the [[bank]] once per day free of charge. He must be asked each time either by talking to him in person or via the [[NPC Contact]] spell, however he will deliver the sand to your bank automatically each day with the completion of the [[elite Ardougne Diary]]. Finally, you can get buckets of sand from the [[Sandstorm]] which resides west of the [[Bandit Camp Quarry|quarry]] in the [[Kharidian Desert|desert]]. Here, you can put [[sandstone]] from the nearby quarry into the grinder to get sand, which can be retrieved from [[Drew]] nearby who you must first give empty [[bucket]]s to, from which you can then get buckets of sand for 50 gold/bucket.
*[[Soda ash]] is made by burning [[seaweed]], [[swamp weed]] or [[giant seaweed]] (which will give 6 soda ash) on a [[range]] or [[fire]] (with no experience in any skill). There are a number of seaweed spawning on Entrana, near the [[Rock Crab]]s in Rellekka, and on [[Karamja]]. Seaweed can also be [[Fishing|fished]] using a [[big fishing net]]. There are two quick spawns inside the Piscatoris Fishing Colony. Additionally, seaweed and soda ash can be bought from [[Trader Stan's Trading Post]] for 5 [[coins]] each. Giant seaweed can be harvested from a [[seaweed patch]] at 21 Farming after planting a [[seaweed spore]].

With all of the ingredients in the [[inventory]], use a bucket of sand and soda ash in a furnace to create [[molten glass]].
:'''Note''': The [[Lunar spell]] [[Superglass Make]] also can be used to convert soda ashes/seaweeds and buckets of sand into molten glass. Buckets will '''not''' be returned, as the spell destroys them completely. Using this spell yields 10 Crafting experience for each bucket of sand used, rather than the 20 normally obtained by using a [[furnace]]. However, this will also make between one and ten extra molten glass.

Use the glassblowing pipe with the molten glass to blow various items.

===Locations===
[[Entrana]] is a good place to blow glass, as it has respawns for [[glassblowing pipe]]s and [[seaweed]] and has a [[sand pit]], a [[range]] and a [[furnace]].

[[Dorgesh-Kaan]] also has a sandpit next to a furnace. [[Molanisk]]s, which can be found just south of the city, drop [[swamp weed]], a suitable substitute for seaweed. There is also a range just to the east of the furnace, making Dorgesh-Kaan an effective place to blow glass. For further crafting experience one can add a [[cave goblin wire]] to a [[light orb]]. Cave goblin wire can be stolen from a machine next to the furnace in Dorgesh-Kaan (level 44 [[Thieving]] required and 22 Thieving [[experience]] gained). Adding the wire gives 104 Crafting experience (level 87 Crafting required).

For those who already have their raw materials in the [[bank]], [[Neitiznot]] has both a clay oven (for burning seaweed) and a clay forge for glassmaking within one click of a [[bank chest]]. Note that Neitiznot is only accessible to those who have completed [[The Fremennik Trials]]. Other suitable locations to glassblow include [[Falador]] and [[Al Kharid]] both of which have banks, ranges and furnaces in close proximity to each other.

===Stills and oil lamps===
In order to fill oil lamps with [[lamp oil]], use a piece of [[swamp tar]] on a [[lamp oil still]] with an empty oil lamp in the [[inventory]]. There are 2 stills in ''[[Gielinor]]'': the scientists house in [[Rimmington]] and the lamp stall in [[Dorgesh-Kaan]].

==Jewellery==
===Gems===
[[Gems]] can be cut with a [[chisel]]. Cutting semiprecious [[gems]] ([[opal]], [[Jade (gem)|jade]] and [[red topaz]]) will sometimes fail and the player will receive a [[crushed gem]] instead. [[Uncut sapphire]] or rarer gems cannot fail to be cut and will always result in a cut gem.

[[File:Defence icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Defence''' is a [[skill]] that grants players protection in all forms of [[combat]]. The higher a target's Defence level, the less likely one is to land successful attacks ([[Melee]] or [[Ranged]]-based damage greater than zero, or [[Magic]]-based offensive spells that don't [[Splashing|Splash]]) against said target. As such, it is a vital skill in high-level [[PvM]] and [[PvP]] situations. Defence '''does not''' decrease the amount of damage that an opponent can deal against you.

A player's Ranged level will not increase their ranged defence, but magical defence is different - it is based on 70% of the player's [[Magic]] level, while the remaining 30% is the player's Defence level, which is then followed by the player's magical defence bonus from their [[armour]].

A player's Defence level also determines which [[equipment]] they are able to wear, as most pieces of armour or other equipment have a Defence level requirement.

Defence is one of the skills that will raise the [[combat level]] of a player regardless of other skill levels. For this reason, many [[combat pure]]s level Defence to a certain level then stop training it to minimise their combat level, giving them an upper hand in Player-versus-Player combat against players around their level. Notable Defence levels are often tied to specific tiers of items or prayers that lead to advantages in combat. To see a complete list of viable optimised Defence level, check the [[Combat pure#Defence level caps|Defence level caps]].

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Defence level up - with unlocks
|filename = Defence level up (with unlocks).ogg
|desc = The music that plays when levelling up and unlocking new content.}}

==Equipment==
Almost every single piece of [[combat equipment]] (except for the ones that go on the [[weapon slot|weapon]], [[cape slot|cape]], [[ring slot|ring]], and [[neck slot|amulet slots]]) requires a certain Defence level to wear. Here are links to tables of armour and equipment that require a Defence level to wear:
*[[Armour]] - For an overview on the different types of armour.
*[[Armour/Melee armour|Melee armour]] - An overview of the different types of Melee armour.
*[[Armour/Magic armour|Magic armour]] - An overview of the different types of Magic armour.
*[[Armour/Ranged armour|Ranged armour]] - An overview of the different types of Ranged armour.
*[[Armour/Prayer armour|Prayer armour]] - An overview of the different types of Prayer armour.
*[[Defender]]s - A [[weapon]] that goes on the [[shield slot]] and provides offensive bonuses while also having an [[Attack]] and Defence levels requirement. The [[rune defender]] provides the same strength bonus as an [[obsidian shield]], while only requiring 40 Defence as opposed to 60.

[[File:Farming icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Farming''' is a [[skill]] in which players plant [[seeds]] and harvest crops. The crops grown range from [[Allotments|vegetables]], [[herbs]] and [[hops]], to wood-bearing [[Tree seed|trees]], [[Cactus seed|cacti]], and [[Mushroom patch|mushrooms]]. The harvested items have a wide variety of uses, and are popular for training [[Herblore]] and [[Cooking]]. Many players sell their harvest for a significant profit.

The plants grown in [[farming patches]] are accessible only to the player who grew them. This is especially useful in the case of wood-bearing trees. Like wild trees, player-grown trees can be chopped down for [[logs]] and [[Woodcutting]] experience, regenerating after a short period of time. But, as they're only accessible to the player who grew them, they can be cut without competition.

Planted crops grow according to set timings, continuing even after a player logs out. This makes it possible to gain large amounts of experience from little in-game time, especially when growing high-experience crops such as trees. Players can also gain rapid experience by planning [[farming run]]s that maximise the number of plants grown at once.

==General overview==
The first thing any player will do when they begin training this skill is to rake away the [[weeds]] from one of the many [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patches]] found scattered around ''RuneScape''. Once cleared, players have the option of applying compost to the patch, which will decrease the chance of the crop becoming diseased, and will also possibly increase the yield of the crop once it reaches maturity. 
[[File:Farming herbs.gif|frame|A player picking herbs grown from farming.]]

===Compost===
[[Compost]] can be bought in farming shops, or obtained by placing a total of 15 weeds or various other unwanted vegetables into one of the [[compost bin]]s. [[Supercompost]], which results in an even higher yield and further lowers chances of disease, is obtained by filling the compost bin with higher level farming produce such as [[pineapple]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[calquat]]s, [[coconut]]s, and high end [[herbs]]. [[Ultracompost]] may be made by adding 25 [[volcanic ashes]] to a full bin of supercompost or adding two volcanic ashes to a bucket of supercompost. Players can also cast the [[Fertile Soil]] spell from the [[Lunar spellbook]] at any point during the plant's growth cycle to apply the effects of [[supercompost]].

===Obtaining Seeds===
[[Seeds]] are usually easy to obtain. They can be bought from players and stalls, stolen via [[Thieving]] or obtained as drops from an enormous variety of monsters. Any lower or intermediate level seeds are usually very cheap, ranging from 1-20 coins each, while the higher level seeds, such as [[Tree patch|tree]], [[Fruit tree seed|fruit tree]], and especially upper end [[herb seed]]s, are usually thousands of coins each, if not more.

===Growth and Disease===
After growing for a preset period of time crops will mature and can then be harvested, provided that the crops have not become diseased and died while growing. Once planted, crops grow even if the player is not online, so one can plant a [[seed]] and come back at any time. Once the crops are fully grown they will remain in the patch indefinitely until harvested; that is, they will not die once fully matured.

However, during this time crops have a chance to become [[Disease (Farming)|diseased]], and die if left unattended in this stage. While players may wish to check on their crops and cure diseased ones, this can prove a time intensive process. Use of supercompost or ultracompost significantly reduces disease risk. To guarantee plants reaching maturity, players can pay nearby [[Group of Advanced Gardeners|gardeners]] to watch crops.

Gardeners all charge for their services, but not in coins. The price that they ask depends on the crop that the player asks them to watch. For example, the price for protecting a patch of [[Potato seed|potatoes]] is two buckets of compost while the price for protecting a patch of [[Onion seed|onions]] is one [[sack of potatoes]]. They will also accept your payment-items in noted form. Gardeners cannot be paid to protect herbs or flowers. When the player has 50% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]], the allotment, flower, and herb patches there will be protected by the local farmer at all times. Players can also unlock two herb patches which are perpetually protected from disease, for free, by completing [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and [[Making Friends With My Arm]].

==Farming equipment==

===Tools===
For farming, there are certain tools you will need to use, whether it's using a [[rake]] to clear a patch or digging up dead plants with a [[spade]]. Below is a table of the basic tools and their uses.

Most of these tools can be bought in the several [[Farming shops]].

====Tool Leprechaun====
[[File:Tool Leprechaun.png|thumb|120px|A tool leprechaun.]]
A [[tool leprechaun]] can be found at any farming patch. Their job is to look after the player's farming tools.

Players can store the following:
*1-100 [[Rake]]
*1-100 [[Seed dibber]]
*1-100 [[Spade]]
*1-100 [[Trowel]]
*1-100 [[secateurs]] or [[magic secateurs]]
*1 [[watering can]] (8) or [[gricoller's can]]
*1 [[Bottomless compost bucket]]
*1-1000 [[plant cure]]s
*1-1000 [[bucket]]s
*1-1000 [[compost]], [[supercompost]] and [[ultracompost]]

The [[tool leprechaun]] will also swap herbs (both grimy and clean) and harvested produce (with some [[Tool Leprechaun#Noting Items|exceptions]]) into [[bank note]]s form by using the unnoted items on the tool leprechaun.

===Magic secateurs===
[[File:Magic secateurs detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Magic secateurs]] are obtained during the quest [[Fairytale I - Growing Pains]]. It is the only [[weapon]] in game that is capable of damaging [[Tanglefoot]]. When equipped or in the inventory, the magic secateurs increase the crop yield of herbs, allotments, grape vines, and hops by 10%, as well as yielding more higher quality herbs from [[Herbiboar]]s.

They are not considered a weapon when travelling to [[Entrana]], as there is a [[hops patch]] on the island. Additionally, because of the stab and slash bonuses, they can be an alternative to the [[Dramen staff]] on the island when using [[Melee]].

===Farming outfit===
[[File:Farmer's outfit (male) equipped.png|thumb|130px|A male player wearing the farmer's outfit.]]
The [[Farmer's outfit]] is an [[experience-boosting set]] that grants bonus Farming experience when worn. A Farming level of 34 is required to wear any of the pieces, as pieces of the outfit are purchased from the [[Tithe Farm]] shop. The outfit costs a total of 400 points to purchase.

===Amulet of nature===
[[File:Amulet of nature detail.png|right|90px]]
The untradeable [[amulet of nature]] is used to monitor the state of a patch. Players can use it on a patch to bind the amulet to the selected patch. The amulet will remain bound to the same patch even after the plant is harvested or removed.

Players wearing the amulet will receive a message if the plant becomes diseased, finishes growing or dies. The message will be received upon log-in if it occured while the player was logged out. The amulet can also be rubbed to learn the current state of the patch.

Players can only have one amulet of nature at a time, but it can be rubbed and bound to new patches indefinitely.

===Other===
* The [[farming cape]] increases the yield of [[herb patch]]es by 5%.
* A woodcutting [[axe]] is needed to chop down [[Tree patch|trees]], [[Fruit tree patch|fruit trees]], [[Hardwood tree patch|hardwoods]], [[crystal tree]]s and [[celastrus tree]]s. Regular trees, fruit trees and hardwoods can also be removed by paying {{Coins|200}} to the [[Group of Advanced Gardeners|gardener]] instead. [[Redwood patch|Redwood trees]] can only be removed by paying [[Alexandra]] {{Coins|2000}}. [[Calquat tree]]s, [[Spirit tree patch|spirit tree]]s and [[Hespori]] do not need to be chopped down to be removed.
* Any kind of glove is needed to harvest [[cave nightshade]] from the [[belladonna patch]].
* An [[amulet of bounty]] offers a 25% chance to use one seed instead of the regular three when planting them in [[allotment patch]]es.
* A [[fishbowl helmet]] and [[diving apparatus]] can be useful when farming giant seaweed, but are not required.
* Herbs will be harvested directly into an open [[herb sack]].

==Seeds==
{{Main|Seeds}}
[[Seeds]] are items that members use to grow crops with the Farming skill. They are essential in training the Farming skill. There are various ways in retrieving them, for example:
*Pickpocketing [[Master Farmer]]s.
*Stealing from [[Seed stall]]s.
*Monster drops.
*[[Bird nest]]s obtained during Woodcutting or from [[Bird house trapping|bird houses]].
*Completing [[Farming contract]]s.
*Hunting certain [[impling]]s, most notably [[Nature impling]]s.
*Minigame rewards, such as various seeds from [[Supply crate|Wintertodt Supply crates]] and [[Barbarian Assault/Rewards#Gambling|Barbarian Assault gambles]] or [[grape seed]]s purchased from [[Tithe Farm]].
*Low level seeds can be bought from [[Draynor Seed Market|Olivia]] and [[Amelia's Seed Shop|Amelia]].
*Purchasing from other players.
*Picking a [[vegetable]] from one of the non-player-owned fields dotted around RuneScape occasionally provides a seed as well.

==Disease, payment, compost and watering==
{{see also|Disease (Farming)}}
[[File:Plant cure detail.png|right|90px]]
When a healthy crop ends a growth cycle, there is a chance it may become diseased. While diseased, the crop stops growing and does not advance to the next stage. Crops do not recover from disease on their own, and die at the end of the diseased cycle if left uncured. Dead crops yield no experience and require use of a spade to dig up their remains before planting another crop in the patch.

Players may treat plants in diseased herb, flower, allotment, bush, hops, tree, fruit tree, hardwood tree, spirit, celastrus, belladonna, cactus, and mushroom patches with [[plant cure]] to restore the crop to health. Doing so may let the crop advance to the next growth stage normally upon the end of the cycle, although it is possible that it may become diseased again. For diseased trees and bushes, the player may use [[secateurs]] on the plant to trim the diseased branch and restore the crop to health. Alternatively, if a player has access to the [[Lunar Magic]] spellbook they may use the [[Cure Plant]] spell instead, which is substantially more expensive but may save the player valuable inventory space during a [[crop running|crop run]].

Crops grow in real-time, so they may become diseased when a player is offline. In addition, crops that have been cured of disease may become afflicted once again. Crops cannot become diseased in the first growth stage (i.e. immediately after the seed has been planted), and fully grown crops will not become diseased.

An [[amulet of nature]] alerts a player to disease occurring in a specific patch if worn, and may also be rubbed to check whether or not a plant is still healthy.

===Reducing disease risk===
Each crop type has a predetermined probability of becoming diseased each crop window. Treating a farming patch with [[compost]], [[supercompost]] or [[ultracompost]] before (or immediately after) planting a crop reduces the chance of disease during all growth cycles, rounded down to the nearest 1/128th. Compost reduces disease risk by 50%, supercompost by 80%, and ultracompost by 90%. If an [[Iasor seed|Iasor]] is planted and alive, disease risk of all crops is reduced by a further 80%,{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1116719428006236162|date=12 April 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/S8rwJ|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Attas affects everything except itself and compost bins. Iasor reduces the chance to 20% of what it would otherwise have been, from what I can see in the code. For Kronos info, I'd suggest trying Kieren.}} to a minimum chance of 1/128 per growth cycle. The risk of a plant becoming diseased without any treatment varies depending on the crop (and in some cases the specific patch).

Watering allotment, flower, and hops patches with a [[watering can]] reduces the risk of disease occurring at the end of that growth cycle.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1206382608466268160|date=16 December 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/OzPlm|archivedate=16 December 2019|quote=[Does watering crops eliminate chance of disease for one grow cycle stage or just reduce it?] It just reduces it. - [Got it. In that case, how much does watering reduce chance of disease?] There isn't a formula as far as I know - the dev who made the skill just set different numbers.}} During the next growth cycle, the plant changes from being watered back to normal and has a higher risk for disease once more, unless it is watered again. Only allotment, flower, and hops patches may be watered.

===Eliminating disease risk===
Planting different [[Flower seed|flowers]] or a [[scarecrow]] provides protection from disease to a variety of crops in allotment patches once the flower is fully grown, while [[white lillies]] protect every type of crop grown in allotment patch.

[[Allotment patch|Allotment]], [[Hops patches|Hops]], [[Bush patches|Bush]], [[Tree patches|Tree]], [[Fruit tree patches|Fruit tree]] and some special farming patches allow you to eliminate disease risk entirely by paying one of the [[Farmer (NPC)|farmers]] near the [[Farming/Patch locations|farming patch]] to watch over it and ensure that it grows to completion. Payment may be noted, but must be in the exact form requested. For instance, a farmer does not accept five [[apples]] in lieu of a [[basket of apples]]. Visit the page linked below for a list of payments required to protect each seed.

{{see also|Seeds}}

==== Disease-free patches ====
* Completing [[My Arm's Big Adventure]] and [[Making Friends with My Arm]] unlocks special herb patches that are immune to disease, although herb yields may still be increased by treating the patches with super/ultracompost.
* With 50% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]], the Hosidius allotment, herb, and flower patches will no longer become diseased.
* With the elite tier of the [[Falador Diary]] complete, the tree patch in [[Falador Park]] will no longer become diseased.

===Compost===
[[File:Ultracompost detail.png|right|90px]]
Besides reducing the chance of a farming patch becoming [[Disease (Farming)|diseased]], [[compost]], [[supercompost]] and [[ultracompost]] also increase the minimum yield and maximum number of harvests received from [[allotment]]s, [[hops]] and [[herb]]s.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1088561370432487424|date=24 January 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/nNpNA|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=[Flower/berry/cactus patches] don't depend on the compost state. Allotments, hops and herbs do.}} This also applies to [[giant seaweed]] patches [[underwater]]{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1019207794350845953|date=17 July 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ZcKoV|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=[Does compost increase giant seaweed yield?] Yeah.}} and [[celastrus bark]] from a fully grown [[celastrus seed]]{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1088630402284224512|date=24 January 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/LeHQ1|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Yes, celastrus would be helped by composting.}}. It should be noted that this only works for one set of seeds. Once the crops are harvested, another bucket of compost must be applied to the patch in order to receive its effects.

{{see also|Compost_Bin#Mechanics}}
Visit the page linked above for instructions on how to make the different tiers of compost.

==Crop types==
{{Main|Farming/Patch locations}}
Crops and trees can be farmed in allocated farming patches, which can be found in several places. All farming patches are divided into a category, therefore seeds can only be grown in certain patches. 

===Allotment, flower, and herb===
{{HasStrategy|page=Crop_running#Allotment,_flower_and_herb_run}}
Allotment, flower, and herb patches are often found together as 2 allotment patches, 1 flower patch, 1 herb patch, and a [[compost bin]].

An additional single allotment patch can be found on [[Harmony Island]], which can be accessed after completing [[The Great Brain Robbery]]. Also, additional herb patches can be accessed at [[Trollheim]] after completing [[My Arm's Big Adventure]], in [[Weiss]] after completing [[Making Friends with My Arm]] and building the [[Fire of Nourishment]] and on [[Harmony Island]] after completion of the elite [[Morytania Diary]].

====Allotment====
{{Main|Allotment patch}}
Allotments are used to grow certain fruits and vegetables that are often used in the [[Cooking]] skill. Each allotment crop requires three seeds to be planted in each patch. Players can pay a nearby gardener to protect their crops, but must do so separately for each patch, even if two are available. Having fully-grown flowers of the corresponding type will protect adjacent allotment patches from getting diseased for as long as the flowers are in the patch, as an alternative to paying a gardener to protect the patch. 

Fully grown allotment patches can be harvested by clicking on the fully grown crops; harvests are generally between 3 and 56 crops. After a patch has been harvested, it is cleared for re-planting.

====Flower====
{{Main|Flower patch}}
A single flower seed is needed to plant in a flower patch; a fully grown flower protects specific allotment crops depending upon the flower's type. Flower patches cannot be protected by a gardener. Most flowers yield one flower when harvested, clearing the patch. [[Limpwurt seed]]s, at minimum, will yield three limpwurt roots. The yield can increase depending on the player's Farming level.{{CiteNews|author=The Old School Team|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=news/bush-yield-improvements-nordic-soft-launch-and-mobile-changes?oldschool=1|title=Bush Yield Improvements, Nordic Soft Launch and Mobile Changes|newsdate=23 August 2018|accessdate=06:22, August 25, 2018 (UTC)}}

====Herb====
{{Main|Herb patch}}
A herb seed can be planted in a herb patch; as certain herb types are expensive, growing herbs with a high Farming level can be lucrative. Herb patches cannot be protected by a gardener. The herb patches at Trollheim and Weiss never become diseased, and the Hosidius patches are also protected if the player has at least 50% Hosidius favour. Harvests generally range between 3 and 18 grimy herbs. Using [[ultracompost]], [[Farming cape]] and [[magic secateurs]], a player will gain an average of 9.5 grimy herbs when harvesting a herb patch.

===Hops===
{{HasStrategy|page=Crop_running#Hop_run}}
{{Main|Hops patch}}
There are four [[hops]] patches: north of [[Lumbridge]], north of [[McGrubor's Wood]], in [[Yanille]] and on [[Entrana]]. Hops grown here can be used with the [[Cooking]] skill for [[brewing]]. Four hop seeds, or three [[jute seed]]s, are needed to plant in each hops patch. Harvests generally vary between 3 and 46 hops. After a hops patch has been harvested it will be cleared for re-planting.

===Bushes===
{{HasStrategy|page=Crop_running#Bush_run}}
{{Main|Bush patch}}
There are five bush patches: west of the [[Champions' Guild]], [[Rimmington]], south of [[Ardougne]], south-west of [[Etceteria]] and in the [[Farming Guild]]. A player can check the health of and then harvest berries from fully grown bushes. This is done by hand and yields a minimum of four berries, with any extra berries depending on the player's Farming level. Unless a bush is dug up, it will continue to regrow berries over time.

===Trees===
{{HasStrategy|page=Crop_running#Tree_run}}
{{Main|Tree patch}}
There are six tree patches: at [[Lumbridge]], [[Varrock Castle]], [[Falador Park]], [[Taverley]], the [[Gnome Stronghold]] and [[Farming Guild]]. Players can grow trees by using a seed on a [[plant pot]] filled with soil to create a [[seedling]]. The seedling then needs to be watered. After a few minutes the seedling will turn into a [[sapling]], which can then be planted in a tree patch.

A fully grown tree acts similarly to the trees that are used in the [[Woodcutting]] skill. After checking a tree's health, players can cut it down using an [[axe]] to receive logs. As with non-player grown trees, there is a chance of a farmed tree dropping [[bird nest]]s. Once a tree is cut down it will leave a tree stump, which can be left to respawn or dug up to gain tree roots and to clear the patch. Players who do not wish to cut down and dig up a tree can use the right-click "pay" option on the tree to instantly remove it. Gardeners can instantly remove a tree for a fee of {{coins|200}}.

===Fruit trees===
{{HasStrategy|page=Crop_running#Fruit_tree_and_calquat_tree_run}}
{{Main|Fruit tree patch}}
There are six fruit tree patches: at [[Gnome Stronghold]], east of [[Catherby]], west of [[Tree Gnome Village (location)|Tree Gnome Village]], [[Brimhaven]], [[Lletya]] and [[Farming Guild]]. Players can grow fruit trees by using a seed on a [[plant pot]] filled with soil to create a [[seedling]]. The seedling then needs to be watered. After a few minutes the seedling will turn into a [[sapling]], which can then be planted in a fruit tree patch.

Once a fruit tree is fully grown the player may check its health and harvest it to receive 6 fruit. A fruit tree will continue to grow fruit over time, unless it is cut down and its stump dug up, with a new fruit regenerating every 45 minutes. Gardeners can instantly remove a fruit tree for a fee of {{coins|200}}.

===Special patches===
{{Main|Special patches}}
Some plants may only be grown in their specific patches. See the main article for more information on these plants and patches.

==Farming guild==
{{Main|Farming Guild}}
The [[Farming Guild]] is a [[members]]-only guild located within the [[Kebos Lowlands]] just north of the [[Kebos Swamp]]. The guild is a large greenhouse separated into three tiers, with each tier requiring an increasing Farming level to enter ([[Temporary skill boost|boosts]] may be used for all tiers). To enter the guild, a minimum farming level of 45 is required along with 60% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]], the Intermediate tier requires level 65, and Advanced tier requires level 85 farming to enter.

===Farming contracts===
[[File:Seed_pack_detail.png|right|100px]]
Because the guild needs to rotate the crops they're growing to stop the soil from tiring due to a lack of nutrients, [[Guildmaster Jane]] can assign [[farming contracts]] that require the player to grow certain crops within the Farming Guild. Players who complete them are awarded with [[seed pack]]s, which contain an assortment of seeds and can include [[Hespori seed|Hespori]], [[Celastrus seed|Celastrus]], and [[Redwood tree seed|redwood seeds]].

There are three tiers of contracts available, with each tier being restricted based on their Farming level and their level of access within the Farming Guild. Boosts may be used to accept a farming contract you are below the level requirement for.

===Hespori patch===
[[File:Hespori fully grown.png|thumb|250px|A fully grown Hespori plant, ready to fight.]]
The Hespori patch, accessible via the cave entrance, is a patch where players with 65 Farming can plant [[Hespori seed]]s. These are randomly obtained when harvesting plants throughout Gielinor or rewarded from farming contracts. The Hespori plant cannot become diseased, and therefore does not need to be watered, composted, or protected by a farmer.

Once the patch has fully grown, which is indicated by the flower behind the cave sprouting open or by going into the cave and checking, the [[Hespori]] can be fought as a solo [[demi-boss]]. Killing the Hespori boss grants Farming experience and seeds, including the unique [[White lily seed|white lily]] and [[anima seed]]s. It can also drop the [[bottomless compost bucket]], which can hold up to 10,000 compost of any kind and doubles any compost added to it. In addition, it has a chance to give the [[Tangleroot]] pet.

The Hespori fight is [[instanced]] but has an item reclaim service that works identically to other grave systems like the [[Grotesque Guardians]], [[Zulrah]], and [[Vorkath]]. If the player dies during the Hespori fight, [[Arno]] will collect and return their items for a fee of 25,000 [[coins]], but if they die in any dangerous area before doing so, any unclaimed items will be permanently lost.

==Tithe Farm==
{{Main|Tithe Farm}}
'''Tithe Farm''' is a Farming based [[minigame]] that is located in [[Hosidius]]. The minigame revolves around intensively planting special seeds into farming patches, tending them until harvest, and depositing the produce into sacks in order to earn points. Players can speak to [[Farmer Gricoller]] for information on how to play.

===Requirements===
In order to play this minigame, players must have 100% [[Hosidius]] [[favour]] and a minimum of 34 Farming in order to pick up the [[Golovanova seed]]s (lowest available) from the table. When trying to enter without seeds, [[Farmer Gricoller]] will stop you.

Three types of seeds can be found on the table near Farmer Gricoller, each requiring a specific Farming level. Players can only take one type of seed, and boosts '''can''' be used, but boosted levels must be maintained when planting seeds.

*[[Golovanova seed]]s ({{SCP|Farming|34}})
*[[Bologano seed]]s ({{SCP|Farming|54}})
*[[Logavano seed]]s ({{SCP|Farming|74}})

Players will also need a [[spade]], a [[seed dibber]] and a [[watering can]] (6 to 8 watering cans are recommended).

===Rewards===
After harvesting the plants, players should deposit the harvest into the sacks found nearby. Depositing harvests will reward players with points and farming experience.

==Mechanics==
===Growth timing===
Crops do not grow continuously; each plant has a discrete set of growth stages, advancing to the next at periodic times called '''growth ticks'''.{{CiteNews|author=The Old School Team|url=https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/farming-timer-rework--skilling-qol?oldschool=1|title=Farming Timer Rework &amp; Skilling QoL|newsdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/SPmUw|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Before describing the new system, it's worth taking a moment to say what a growth tick actually is. Imagine the game has clocks that tick every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes, every 20 minutes, every 40 minutes, and so on.}} The frequency of growth occurring is determined by the type of seed, e.g. a spirit tree's growth stages last 320 minutes. In comparison, hops' growth stages last 10 minutes. The shortest is 5 minutes, which includes flowers, weeds growing and tree seedlings growing into saplings. For a full list of growth stage durations and the number of stages for each type of crop, see [[Seeds]]. The [[Kronos seed|Kronos]] plant provides a chance for farming patches (excluding itself) to skip a growth stage during their next growth cycle; this chance is shared between all farming patches of that growth cycle.

The pattern of growth ticks is shown in the table below. However, there is an offset of up to 30 minutes which is '''different per player''', and persists through logins.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1112039756764983296|date=30 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/RzheL|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=It persists through logins, and does not re-randomise.}} To determine this offset, note the time when a slow crop grows, and compare with the next time listed. Then apply the difference to every time in the table. This offset is always negative, causing growth ticks to occur up to 30 minutes prior to the times listed here.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1592825645901709313|date=16 November 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.is/8bqFS|archivedate=4 April 2022|quote=The offset still applies, though it ranges from 0 - 31 rather than -15 - +15.}} For example, if a mahogany tree grows at 10:28 AM on Day 1, subtract 12 minutes from each time listed.

In the table above, {{#time: l j F Y}} is Day {{#expr:floor({{#time:U}} / 86400) mod 4 + 1}}. ''Note: this is usually today, but does not update immediately when the date changes: {{purge|Click here to clear the cache and force an update|tag=span}} in case.''

The time for a newly-planted seed to grow to the second stage is typically less than the full time between growth ticks. For example, herb seeds grow every 20 minutes. Suppose a player with zero offset plants a seed at 6:35. A growth tick for herbs will occur at 6:40, and the herbs then grow to the second stage, having spent five minutes in the first growth stage instead of the stated 20.

The following is a schematic representation of the growth ticks. The green bars represent the times when plants will grow. Each time a plant grows, all plants with shorter growth stages will also grow, so there is a time every 640 minutes when all plants grow simultaneously.

===Variable crop yield===
[[Herb patch|Herbs]], [[Allotment patch|allotments]], [[Hops patch|hops]], [[Bush patch|bushes]], [[belladonna]], [[Special patches#Cactus patches|cacti]], [[Limpwurt plant|limpwurt]], [[Celastrus tree|celastrus]], and [[Seaweed (Farming)|giant seaweed]] all produce varying amounts of items when you harvest them.

For herbs, allotments, hops, and giant seaweed, the mechanism to determine how many items can be harvested is based on "harvest lives." A fully-grown patch initially has three lives, with additional lives when compost is used (one additional life for regular [[compost]], two for [[supercompost]], and three for [[ultracompost]]).{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1035091924099772417|date=30 August 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/HIz8O|archivedate=31 March 2023|quote=For any patch that works that way, including herbs, you start with 3. Standard compost makes it 4, super compost makes it 5, ultra compost makes it 6.}} Each time a crop is harvested, there is a chance of one of these lives being used, continuing until there are no more harvest lives and the patch becomes empty. The chance of a harvest life being saved is determined and can be increased in various ways:

* Farming level and crop type: This determines the base chance to save a harvest life and is a function of both Farming level and what is being planted.{{CiteReddit|author=Mod Kieren|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3x8o8t/mod_archie_really_needs_to_stop_paraphrasing/cy2gwmv/|title=Mod archie really needs to stop paraphrasing questions wrong.|quote=[I]f you're 99 farming, your average yield from guam and torstol will be exactly the same. However it is not the same at all levels... Let's say you are level 50 farming, and have an irit plant ready to harvest and a guam plant. The chances come in with whether you lose a life or not each pick of a herb. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking a guam would be roughly 53/255. Your base chance of not losing a life when picking an irit would be roughly 63/255. These chances scale depending on your level, but all peak at the same probability at level 99.

* Completing the [[Kourend &amp; Kebos Diary]]: 5% Hard ([[Hosidius#Farming patches|Hosidius]] and [[Farming Guild]] herb patches only)

&lt;math&gt;ChanceToSave = \frac{\frac{CTS_{low} (99-F)}{98}+ \frac{CTS_{high} (F-1)}{98} +1}{256} &lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;F =&lt;/math&gt; {{SCP|Farming}} Farming Level
* &lt;math&gt;CTS_{low}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;CTS_{high} =&lt;/math&gt; the raw &lt;math&gt;ChancetoSave&lt;/math&gt; values at level 1 and 99 Farming respectively for the specific crop being grown

The boosts laid out above work by modifying the high and low &lt;math&gt;CTS&lt;/math&gt; values before being interpolated. The order in which these boosts are applied is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;CTS = \lfloor CTS * (1 + ItemBonus) \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;CTS = CTS + DiaryBonus&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;CTS = \lfloor CTS * (1 + AttasBonus) \rfloor&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
* &lt;math&gt;ItemBonus =&lt;/math&gt; 0.1 with {{plink|magic secateurs}} and 0.05 with {{plink|Farming cape|txt=Farming}} or {{plink|max cape}}s, for a total of 0.15 with both
* &lt;math&gt;DiaryBonus =&lt;/math&gt; 25, 17, or 10 for the elite, hard, and medium Catherby Diary respectively, and 10 for the hard Kourend &amp; Kebos Diary
* &lt;math&gt;AttasBonus =&lt;/math&gt; 0.05 if an [[attas plant]] is currently growing in the player's [[Farming Guild#Anima patch|anima patch]]

The absolute minimum number of crops harvested is equal to the number of lives the player started with (for example, six with ultracompost), but there is no theoretical upper limit on the size of a harvest. It is, however, exceedingly rare to get very large harvests, and over the course of multiple harvests it will tend towards the expected yield due to the {{wp|law of large numbers}}, a negative binomial distribution of:

&lt;math&gt; Expected Yield = \frac{Harvest Lives}{1-Chance to Save}&lt;/math&gt;

===Average yield per crop type===
{{Incomplete|Ranges need to be recalculated based on known CTS values.}}
These averages depend on knowing the chance of a harvest life being saved, which is unknown for the majority of variable yield crops other than herbs, but can be estimated after numerous harvests.

The following estimates are based off of experimental findings (unless cited with exact numbers), an presuppose the use of both the magic secateurs and the Farming cape at 99 Farming with ultracompost:
* Herbs give an average of 9 [[herb]]s per patch.{{NamedRef|ChancetoSave}}
* Allotments give an average of 40–50 produce per patch.
* Bushes give an average of 15–20 berries per patch.
* Hops give an average of 30–40 hops per patch.
* Belladonna give an average of 8 [[cave nightshade]] per patch.

==Farming pet==
[[File:Tangleroot (follower).png|right|90px]]
{{Main|Tangleroot}}
The [[Tangleroot]] is a skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained when checking the health and harvesting the final crops of any fully grown [[farming patch]]. It can also be obtained while playing the [[Tithe Farm]] [[minigame]], or from killing the [[Hespori]]. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Farming level and the produce the player is harvesting.

[[File:Firemaking icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Firemaking''' is a [[skill]] used to light fires, among other things. It is the artisan companion skill of [[Woodcutting]]. Firemaking is trained by players to complete [[quests]] or participate in [[minigames]]. A number of quests with quality rewards require Firemaking levels, such as [[Recipe for Disaster]] and [[Desert Treasure I]]. Similarly, Firemaking-oriented minigames with useful rewards include [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] and the [[Wintertodt|Wintertodt boss]]. Firemaking allows players to light logs in order to be able to cook food anywhere, albeit with a higher burn chance than with a [[range]]. [[Wintertodt]] is a solid way to train Firemaking while also being profitable. Subduing the Wintertodt is the only way to obtain the [[pyromancer outfit]].

Burnt-out fires leave behind [[ashes]] which some members may use to train [[Herblore]] with by making [[Serum 207]]. Players can turn a profit from burning cheaper logs and collecting the ashes, though at the cost of experience per hour.

==How to make fires==
[[File:Fire.gif|thumb|80px|left|A fire burning.]]
[[File:Firemaking.gif|thumb|A player lights logs.]]
To make a [[fire]], players need any [[Log (disambiguation)|log]] and a [[tinderbox]]. Alternatively, they may use most [[Bow|bows]], which requires the Firemaking section of [[Barbarian Training#Part one: Lighting a fire with a bow|Barbarian Training]].

To burn a log, a player must:
*Use a tinderbox with the log, or a log with the tinderbox. When a player does this, they will drop the log and light it with the tinderbox.
*Drop the log, then right click the log and select the 'light log' option.
*Drop the log, then use the tinderbox with the log.
*Using a bow on the log causes the log to drop and kindles a fire. Only members have this ability, and must complete [[Barbarian Training]] to do so.

Once the player creates a fire, they will walk one step to the west if there is room there; otherwise, they will take one step east. If both ways are blocked, the player will move south. If all three ways are blocked, the player will travel north.

Players can go to a large open area such as the Grand Exchange and light many logs in a row. After starting one fire with a clear path to the west, more fires could be rapidly lit. When the avatar is in the process of making one fire, the player would prepare to start the next immediately after lighting the first fire.

In addition, players may bring an additional tinderbox placed in opposite corners of their inventory to slightly reduce mouse travelling movement.

Fires require an empty ground upon which to light, with additional restrictions on select buildings and other locations, including plants and ferns, adjacent to growing vines, in doorways. Additionally, closed doors block the creation of fires—except in [[Draynor]]. Conversely, open doors do not prevent Firemaking.

==List of combustible logs==
Different logs require different levels to ignite, as shown in the table below. When a log is lit, it will stay on fire for a short while. How long a fire stays lit is always random despite the player's Firemaking level and type of log. As a result, [[yew logs]] do not necessarily burn longer than [[willow logs]]. Players '''can''' use temporary boosts to burn logs which they otherwise may not be able to (for example, a player with 85 Firemaking could use a spicy stew to boost to 90 in order to burn redwood logs).

==Pyre logs==
To make pyre logs, players need [[sacred oil]], created during the [[Shades of Mort'ton (minigame)|Shades of Mort'ton]] minigame. Sacred oil is created from [[olive oil]] (sold in the [[Razmire General Store]] in [[Mort'ton]]), and requires the player to assist in repairing and/or defending the [[Flamtaer]] temple north of Mort'ton. Once the temple has been fully repaired, the altar in the centre of the temple can be lit and olive oil can be used on the altar to turn it into sacred oil. Sanctifying oil drains Sanctity points, which are passively gained as the player repairs and defends the temple, so the oil cannot be sanctified without participating in the minigame, even if the temple is repaired and the altar is lit by other players.

A pyre log is obtained by applying sacred oil to the corresponding regular version of the log. Players can use sacred oil on the log. This will turn the log into a pyre log, which can be used in combination with [[Shade remains]] on the funeral pyres around the outskirts of Mort'ton to cremate the remains, yielding [[Shade key]]s. Higher level logs require more doses of sacred oil to convert each log into a pyre log.

==Barbarian Firemaking==
Barbarian Firemaking is part of the [[Barbarian training]] that starts by talking to [[Otto Godblessed]] close to [[Barbarian Outpost]]. A player must have a Firemaking level of at least 35 in order to burn the oak log that is required for the Firemaking portion of Barbarian training.

There are two types of activities that fall under Barbarian Firemaking: lighting fires with a bow and lighting pyre ships.

===Bow firemaking===
Barbarian Firemaking works by using most types of [[bow]]s in the [[inventory]] on a log. [[Crystal bow|Crystal]], [[Ogre bow|Ogre]], and [[Dark bow]]s will not work. Bow Firemaking requires 20 levels higher in Firemaking than normal in order to light the same type of [[log]] as with a [[tinderbox]], yet gives no additional Firemaking experience.

There are no inherent advantages or disadvantages to use a bow instead of a tinderbox, except for freeing up an inventory slot.

===Pyre ships===
{{Main|Barbarian Training#Pyre ships}}
'''Warning''': This activity is dangerous.

Items needed:
*[[Logs]]
*[[Tinderbox]] or [[bow]]
*[[Hatchet]] to carve the pyre ship
*Ideally, [[chewed bones]]. Players can substitute [[mangled bones]] if necessary. When using mangled bones, bring [[armour]], [[weapons]], and [[food]] as a level 166 [[ferocious barbarian spirit]] will attack. The [[Protect from Melee]] [[prayer]] can provide additional protection.

This activity requires both Firemaking and [[Crafting]] levels of at least 11 to participate. [[Chewed bones|Chewed]] and [[mangled bones]] are acquired in the [[Ancient Cavern]], a very high risk area. Use the required items on one of the burnt spaces (pyre sites) just north of [[Otto's Grotto]] to make a pyreship. Burning a pyreship will grant the player a prayer bonus of up to 300%, depending on the logs used, the next time the player buries [[bones]].

{{Table/Pyre ships}}

==Torches, candles and lanterns==
[[Members]] can light [[lanterns]] to increase visibility in poorly lit areas. Players cannot receive experience by lighting a lantern. Some lanterns require [[glass]], which can be made by using the [[Crafting]] skill. There is a shop in [[Dorgesh-Kaan]], which sell lanterns and other Firemaking equipment. There is also a [[Candle Shop]] in [[Catherby]] where you can buy [[candles]].

==Success chance==
Based on crowdsourced data, the chance of successfully lighting any type of log, other than logs coloured with a [[gnomish firelighter]], is believed to be 65/256 at level 1 and 513/256 at level 99, interpolating linearly in between. Coloured logs will always have a 100% chance of being ignited.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1121109749771198466|date=24 April 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.vn/U1BO4|archivedate=15 February 2021|quote=Coloured logs... are always guaranteed to light.|notes=|name=|group=}}

[[File:Fishing icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Fishing''' is a [[skill]] which involves catching [[fish]] from selected [[Fishing spots|spots]] around [[Gielinor]]. Higher Fishing levels enable different mechanisms of Fishing, the ability to catch a larger selection of fish and increases a player's catch rate. Caught fish may be cooked through the [[Cooking]] skill to create [[food]] which may be used later to regain [[hitpoints]] during [[combat]]. Alternatively, many players sell their excess stock of catches for [[coins|gold]].

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Fishing level up - with unlocks

|desc = The music that plays when levelling up and unlocking new content.}}

==Fish==
{{Main|Fish}}
When caught, most [[fish]] will be raw and cannot be eaten until they are [[Cooking|cooked]]. The name and colour indicates this. For example, when [[shrimps]] are first caught they are named "[[raw shrimps]]", but once cooked the name changes to "shrimps".

===Clue in a bottle===
{{Main|Clue bottle}}
While fishing, players may also occasionally receive [[clue bottle]]s that contains a [[clue scroll]] of the following difficulties: [[Clue bottle (beginner)|beginner]], [[Clue bottle (easy)|easy]], [[Clue bottle (medium)|medium]], [[Clue bottle (hard)|hard]], and [[Clue bottle (elite)|elite]]. [[Clue scroll (master)|Master clue scrolls]] cannot be obtained from clue bottles.

==Fishing methods==
===Equipment===
Players need the right kind of equipment to catch the [[fish]] they want. Basic Fishing equipment can be purchased in [[fishing shops]]. Players can buy fishing equipment from the fishing store in [[Port Sarim]] and from the fishing store in [[Catherby]]. More advanced fishing methods may need to be found or crafted.

===Nets===
[[File:Small net fishing.png|thumb|300px|A player fishing on a [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]].]]The first few fish players can catch require nets. Players can use [[small fishing net]]s and [[big fishing net]]s. The big nets only allow players to catch different types of fish and sometimes items, such as [[casket]]s. When a player has found a [[fishing spot]], they can then use their net if the option "net fishing spot" is available. "Net fishing spot" can be found in: [[Draynor Village]], [[Lumbridge Swamp]], [[Musa Point]], the coastline near [[Rimmington]], the [[Wilderness Bandit Camp]], [[Al Kharid]], and [[Corsair Cove]].

===Fishing rods and bait===
[[File:Baiting.png|thumb|300px|This player is using a [[fishing rod]].]]
[[Fishing rod]]s are required for mid level fishing in both rivers and seas. Along with a fishing rod, players also need [[Fishing bait|bait]]. Bait can be bought in stores (3 [[coins]] each at the [[Port Sarim]] [[Gerrant's Fishy Business|fishing shop]]), but is also dropped by some [[monsters]] and [[random events]]. When a player has found a [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]], they can then use their fishing rod if the option "bait fishing spot" is available. For every [[fish]] you catch, you lose one piece of bait.

The [[oily fishing rod]] is a [[members]] only item required to catch [[infernal eels]] when used with [[ice gloves]] and to catch [[Raw lava eel|lava eels]] for the [[Heroes' Quest]]. The pearl variants such as the [[Pearl fishing rod]] are cosmetic and not improvements over the basic fishing rod, although they can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.

===Fly fishing rods and feathers===
[[Fly fishing rod]]s are also required for mid level fishing. These rods can only be used in rivers. Along with a fly fishing rod, players also need [[feather]]s. They can be bought from the [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] and [[Port Sarim]] [[Gerrant's Fishy Business|fishing shop]], but are also dropped by [[chicken]]s. When a player has found a [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]], they can then use their fly fishing rod if the option "lure fishing spot" is available.

[[Stripy feather]]s (introduced with the [[Hunter]] [[skill]]) can be used for fly fishing, as well. Those feathers work the same as normal feathers, but players will only be able to fish [[Raw rainbow fish|rainbow fish]], rather than the usual [[Raw trout|trout]] and [[Raw salmon|salmon]]. The [[Pearl fly fishing rod]] is cosmetic and not an improvement over the basic fly fishing rod, although it can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.

===Harpoon===
[[File:Harpooning.png|thumb|300px|This player is using a [[harpoon]] to fish.]]
[[Harpoon]]s are required for mid and high level [[fish]]. Harpoons can only be used in the seas. When a player has found a [[fishing spot]], they can then use their harpoon if the option "harpoon fishing spot" is available. [[raw swordfish|Swordfish]] and [[raw tuna|tuna]] are caught in cage/harpoon fishing spots, while [[raw shark|sharks]] are caught in net/harpoon spots.

There are five types of harpoons - the regular harpoon, the [[barb-tail harpoon]], the [[dragon harpoon]], the [[infernal harpoon]], and the [[crystal harpoon]]. The dragon harpoon and infernal harpoon both have a 20% faster catch rate than the regular harpoon, and the crystal harpoon has a 35% faster catch rate. The barb-tail harpoon, dragon harpoon, infernal harpoon, and crystal harpoon can all be wielded. Many players prefer these harpoons as it saves an [[inventory]] space.

After being taught by [[Otto Godblessed]], a player can catch fish that are harpoonable with just their hands. The fishing level requirement is 20 levels higher and it also requires a [[Strength]] level equal to the fishing level needed to catch the fish normally, but a small amount of strength experience is gained and the player doesn't need a harpoon equipped or in their inventory.

[[File:Caging.png|thumb|300px|This player is using a [[lobster pot]] to catch [[Raw lobster|lobster]]s.]]
[[Raw lobster|Lobster]]s are caught in the sea by using [[lobster pot]]s. When a player has found a [[Fishing spots|fishing spot]], they can then use their lobster pot if the option "cage fishing spot" is available. This is also true for [[Raw Dark Crab|Dark Crabs]], with the only exception being [[Dark Fishing Bait]] must also be in a player's inventory.

===Cormorant's glove===
[[Aerial fishing]] is a ranged fishing technique at the center of [[Lake Molch]] requiring 35 [[Hunter]] and 43 [[Fishing]]. Players are given a [[Cormorant's glove]] for free by talking to [[Alry the Angler]]. While equipped the [[Cormorant]] eats [[King worm|King worms]] or [[Fish chunks]] ''(taken from inventory similar to bait)'' to fly over the lake's surface, collect and return various unique aquatic creatures to the player. Catches include [[Bluegill]], [[Common tench]], [[Molted eel]] and [[Greater siren]] based on the fishing and hunter levels of the player.  A knife can be used on these catches to give cooking experience and receive fish chunks which makes the process sustainable.

Additional rewards include the the [[Molch pearl]] currency which can be used to purchase the [[Pearl fishing rod]], [[Pearl fly fishing rod]], [[Pearl barbarian rod]] and [[Fish sack]]. These are equipable versions of common fishing equipment for additional inventory capacity. Although pearls can also purchase parts of the [[Angler's outfit]] It's a much slower method than the recommended [[Fishing trawler]] minigame.

===Drift Nets===
[[Drift net fishing]] is a special fishing method that requires 44 [[Hunter]] and 47 [[Fishing]] accessible after completing [[Bone Voyage]]. Unlike fishing from a spot on the surface, this occurs in the [[Underwater]] area of [[Fossil Island]] where [[fish shoal]]s are chased into [[Drift net]]s set by the player beforehand. Collecting fish shoals from the nets can reward various fish depending on your fishing level including [[Raw tuna|tuna]], [[Raw lobster|lobster]], [[Raw swordfish|swordfish]], [[Raw shark|sharks]] and at higher levels is one of the few methods to catch [[Raw sea turtle|sea turtles]] and [[Raw manta ray|manta rays]].

===Karambwan vessels===
[[Karambwan vessel]]s can be obtained from [[Lubufu]] south of [[Brimhaven]] once a player has started the [[Tai Bwo Wannai Trio]] [[Quests|quest]] and they can be bought from [[Tiadeche's Karambwan Stall]] in [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] once they have completed the quest. Karambwan vessels are loaded with [[Raw karambwanji|karambwanji]], which are caught from the lake that is near Lubufu. [[Raw karambwan|Karambwan]] are caught at the north-east shore north of the [[Ship Yard]].

===Barbarian Fishing===
[[Members]] with level 48 in Fishing can speak with [[Otto Godblessed]] in his [[Otto's Grotto|home]] near [[Baxtorian Falls]] to learn special [[Barbarian Training|barbarian methods]] of fishing.
 
=====Heavy Rod Fishing=====
First, he instructs the player on heavy rod fishing. Heavy rod fishing requires a [[barbarian rod]] (found under Otto's bed) and any type of bait (except for [[Stripy feather|stripy]]/coloured feathers), as well as a [[knife]] to gut the fish. In order to catch the special fish in Otto's lake, a [[Strength]] and [[Agility]] level is needed in addition to the fishing requirement. The [[leaping fish]] obtained can be used with a knife to obtain [[roe]] and [[caviar]] for use in the [[Herblore]] [[skill]], and catching them gives small amounts of [[experience]] in Strength and Agility. The [[Pearl barbarian rod]] is cosmetic and not an improvement over the basic Barbarian rod, although it can be equipped which frees up a single inventory slot.

|-
|}

=====Bare Handed Fishing =====
After this, the player can learn how to fish [[Raw tuna|tuna]], [[Raw harpoonfish|harpoonfish]], [[Raw swordfish|swordfish]], and [[Raw shark|sharks]] without a [[harpoon]]. Using this method requires a higher Fishing level as well as a Strength level equivalent to the Fishing level needed to catch the fish normally. However, it provides small amounts of Strength experience. At level 55, players can expect rates of 10,000 Fishing experience per hour, steadily increasing to 13,000 experience per hour at level 69. At level 70, catching both tuna and swordfish nets roughly 24,000 Fishing experience per hour.

==Other Equipment==
===Rada's blessing===
Rada's blessing will give you an extra chance at catching a fish, with no additional experienced granted, starting at 2% for the [[Rada's blessing 1]] to 8% with the [[Rada's blessing 4]].

===Spirit Flakes===
Spirit flakes give a 50% chance of yielding double catch everywhere excluding [[Tempoross]] and the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]], at the cost of one flake per fish caught (no additional XP is given). This stacks with Rada's blessing.

=== Angler's Outfit===
Obtained through the [[Fishing trawler]] minigame and [[Aerial fishing]], pieces of the [[Angler's outfit]] grant a bonus to fishing XP gained, increasing to 2.5% with the full outfit.

==Fishing spots==
{{Main|Fishing spots}}
Players may fish at various fishing spots located around [[Gielinor]], while fishing, the location of a [[fishing spot]] may move from one spot to another within the same area, requiring the player to move in order to continue. The only exceptions to this are select fishing spots located within the wilderness and Karambwan fishing spots.

===Net and bait fishing spots===
* [[Draynor Village]] - To the south-west of Draynor Village's [[bank]] are some [[fishing spots]]. Here, players can [[Small fishing net|net]] and [[Fishing rod|bait]] [[fish]]. It is a great place to start fishing as there is a bank nearby. However, there are two level 7 [[Dark wizard]]s that can be a problem for players under level 15.
*[[Mudskipper Point]] - South of [[Port Sarim]] are two to three fishing spots dotting the western shore of the peninsula, located behind the church and near [[Thurgo]]'s shack. However, the nearest banks are either Draynor Village or [[Pest Control]].
*[[Brimhaven]] - To the south of Brimhaven are some fishing spots. However, these spots are far away from a bank, so if a player wants to deposit their fish, it is recommended to fish at Draynor Village.
*[[Corsair Cove]] - To the south-west of the cove, south of the [[Corsair Cove Dungeon]] entrance.
*[[Lumbridge Swamp]] - At the east side of the swamp is the [[Fishing tutor]], giving a free small net to players that have lost theirs, and some low level fishing spots.
* [[Al Kharid]] - There are some [[Raw shrimps|shrimp]] fishing spots south of the Al Kharid bank, approximately as far as the fishing spots in Draynor Village are from the bank. However, the [[scorpion]]s can be a problem for people with low levels.
*[[Catherby]] - Along the south-eastern shore. Close to a bank.
*[[Entrana]] - Players cannot bring any [[armour]] or [[weapons]] on Entrana.
*[[Isafdar]] - Could be useful for emergency [[food]] supplies.
*[[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] - North-west of the [[Grand Tree]], or by using the [[fairy ring]] code {{Fairycode|akq}}. Players can use a small net to catch [[Raw monkfish|monkfish]], which are exclusive to this area. Piscatoris is only accessible after the completion of the [[Swan Song]] [[quest]].
*[[Karamja]] lake - Shrimp and [[Raw karambwanji|karambwanji]]. South of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]].
*[[Bandit Camp (Wilderness)|Wilderness Bandit Camp]] - There is one spot in the level 24 [[Wilderness]]. There is no bank, and [[Aggressiveness|aggressive]] level 22 and 130&lt;sup&gt;([[members]]' worlds)&lt;/sup&gt; [[Bandit]]s are nearby.
*[[Port Piscarilius]] - Along the north-eastern shore. Very close to a bank. Requires 100% Piscarilius favour.

===Lure and bait fishing spots=== 
*[[Barbarian Village]] - On the eastern side of the village is the [[River Lum]]. In the river are some [[fishing spots]] where players can [[Fly fishing rod|lure]] and [[Fishing rod|bait]] [[fish]]. Players can bank in [[Soul Wars]] bank by using the portal south of [[Edgeville]].
*[[Lumbridge]] - In the centre of Lumbridge is the River Lum. In the river are some spots where players can lure and bait fish. This used to be an unpopular fishing spot, until the addition of [[Lumbridge Castle]]'s bank.
*Between [[Seers' Village]] and [[Sinclair Mansion]]
*[[Entrana]] - Players cannot bring any [[armour]] or [[weapons]] on Entrana.
*[[Tree Gnome Stronghold]]
*[[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] - Completion of the [[Shilo Village]] [[quest]] is required for entry into the village. These locations are quite close to a bank.
*[[Observatory]] - Not too far north of [[Castle Wars]].
*[[Hosidius]] - Along the river north-west of Hosidius, and just to the east of the city kitchen task, where there is a bank chest.
*[[Water Ravine Dungeon]] - Unpopular spot due to distance from bank, need for [[Ancestral key]] and [[Robe of elidinis (top)|Robes of elidinis]] to access, and partial completion of [[Spirits of the Elid]] quest.
*North of [[West Ardougne]], near [[Rasolo]].
*:'''Note:''' [[Raw trout|Trout]] and [[Raw salmon|salmon]] can be sold to Rasolo for 2 and 5 [[coins]] respectively.

===Big net fishing spots=== 
*[[Catherby]] - Along the south-eastern shore. Close to a [[bank]].
*[[Fishing Guild]] - Requires 68 Fishing. Very close to a bank.
*[[Rellekka]]
*[[Burgh de Rott]]
*[[Land's End]]
*[[Ape Atoll]]

===Harpoon &amp; Lobster Pot fishing spots===
* [[Karamja]] - Behind [[Luthas]]' [[banana]] plantation on the northern part of the island is a small dock that has [[fishing spots]] where players can [[harpoon]], [[Lobster pot|cage]], or [[Small fishing net|net]] [[fish]]. Unfortunately a [[bank]] is very far away, and players have to pay 30 [[coins]] to go to the island and 30 coins to leave the island, but there is a [[bank deposit box]] on the dock in [[Port Sarim]]. This place is rarely used by members, as better areas are available.
* [[Corsair Cove Resource Area]] - North of the [[Myths' Guild]]. Requires completion of [[Dragon Slayer I]] to access.
*[[Wilderness]] - At level 35 to 38 in the Wilderness are some harpoon and cage fishing spots in the waters at the eastern edge. [[Raw Dark Crab]]s can be fished off the north-eastern coast, south of the fence containing the [[members-only]] deep wilderness. However, players risk being attacked by other players here, and a bank is very far away.
*[[Resource Area]] - This [[members-only]] location contains [[Dark Crab]] fishing spots where a player can fish as long as they please as they can note their resources, via [[Piles]] for 50 coins per item noted. The fastest way to the location is the [[Lever (Edgeville)|Edgeville Teleport Lever]]. Note that a player must spend anywhere from 7,500 coins to 3,750 coins without completion of the [[Wilderness Diary]] in order to gain entry to the area. Note that fishing here may place players in potentially dangerous [[Player killing|PvP]] scenarios.
*[[Catherby]] - Along the south-eastern shore. Close to a bank.
*[[Rellekka]] - Very useful if fighting in the area due to the lack of bank.
*[[Fishing Guild]] - Requires 68 Fishing. Very close to a bank.
*[[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]] - Here players can net and harpoon fish after the completion of the [[Swan Song]] [[quest]].
*[[Burgh de Rott]] - [[Raw shark|Sharks]] only.
*[[Iorwerth Camp]] - Sharks only, good area if you are fighting, otherwise, it is far from a bank.
*[[Jatizso]] - [[Raw lobster|Lobster]], [[Raw swordfish|swordfish]], sharks and close to bank. Requires completion of [[The Fremennik Trials]].

=== Other fishing spots===
These generally are one specific place for one specific type of fishing. 
*[[Lumbridge Swamp Caves]], [[Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon]], [[Mort Myre Swamp]], and south of Mort Myre - [[Fishing rod|Bait]] fishing for [[Raw slimy eel|slimy eels]] and [[Raw cave eel|cave eels]].
*Lumbridge Swamp Caves, and Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon - [[Small fishing net|Net]] fishing for [[frog spawn]].

*[[Port Khazard]] - [[Fishing Trawler|Trawler]] fishing.
*[[ScapeRune]] - Here, players can net fish cooked fish and uncook them in the uncooking pot. This is part of the [[Evil Bob]] [[random event]].

*[[Mor Ul Rek]] - Bait fishing using an oily fishing rod and bait while wearing ice gloves are required to catch [[infernal eel]]. Can only be caught once a player has proven themselves worthy enough to enter the city by showing a TzHaar guard guarding the entrance a fire cape
*[[Lake Molch]] - [[Lake Molch#Catching Fish|Aerial fishing]] using a Cormorant to catch fish from fishing pools that move every 7–12 seconds.
*[[Fishing Guild]] platform - [[Minnow]]s can be caught in Kylie Minnow's fishing platform with a small net. They can be exchanged for noted raw sharks.
*[[Port Piscarilius]] - [[Anglerfish]] can be caught along the north-western shore; this location is very close to a bank.

== Fishing Trawler==
{{Main|Fishing Trawler}}
[[Fishing Trawler]] is a Fishing [[minigame]] found at [[Port Khazard]]. Level 15 Fishing is required to receive [[fish]] at the end of the trip. World 370 is the ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' designated Fishing Trawler world. It can be overwhelming for a single player, so it is recommended to participate in a group.

Players board [[Murphy]]'s trawler boat and work as a team to protect the boat from hazards and prevent it from sinking for five minutes as they sail across the oceans. Holes in the ship, flooding, sea monsters and broken netting are all hazards players must overcome to keep afloat. Failing these tasks may shipwreck players and force them to swim back to shore. 

If the trawler net is not ripped at the end of the trip, players may receive [[fish]] based on their Fishing level. This is one of the few methods in which you are able to catch [[Raw sea turtle|sea turtles]] and [[Raw manta ray|manta rays]]. There is a 1/12 chance to receive a piece of the [[Angler's outfit]] after a successful trip. This outfit increases Fishing experience gain and allows access to special fishing areas.

{|
| {{Skill outfit|Angler hat|Angler top|Angler waders|Angler boots}}
|}

==Tempoross==
{{Main|Tempoross}}
[[Tempoross]] is a Fishing-based skilling boss found at the [[Ruins of Unkah]]. Players need at least level 35 Fishing to participate. World 341, 422, 463 and 531 are the ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' designated Tempoross worlds.

Players board the boat on the dock and sail to [[Tempoross Cove]] to help the [[Spirit Anglers]] subdue Tempoross. As a skilling boss, players use Fishing to catch [[harpoonfish]] as ammunition, firing them out of cannons to weaken Tempoross while avoiding various special attacks. When Tempoross is weak enough it'll submerge and can be damaged directly by harpooning the pools near him. Players must be careful not to let Tempoross get too enraged as it'll wash them off the island.

Defeating Tempoross will grant Fishing experience and reward permits based on participation. These permits allow you to fish at the [[reward pool]] for a chance at many unique or high quality fishing items in addition to [[fish]] based on your Fishing level. This is one of the few methods to gather [[Raw sea turtle|sea turtles]] and [[Raw manta ray|manta rays]]. Other rewards include the coveted [[fish barrel]], the [[tackle box]] or the components to upgrade the [[Angler's outfit]] into the [[Spirit angler's outfit]].

==Fishing pets==
[[File:Heron (follower).png|right|150x150px]]
*The [[Heron]] is a members-only skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained while training [[Fishing]]. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Fishing level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.
*A [[tiny tempor]] may be obtained by fishing it from the [[reward pool]] outside the [[Ruins of Unkah]] after defeating the [[Tempoross]].

[[File:Fletching icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Fletching''' is a [[skill]] which allows the player to create various types of [[ranged weapons]] and their [[ammunition]]. The products of this skill are primarily used in the combat skill, [[Ranged]]. It also provides some of the most popular materials used for [[High Alchemy]], which is a commonly used method for training the [[Magic]] skill.

At a higher Fletching level, the skill can be trained without losing any [[coins]], although a decent amount of working capital is very useful. Money can usually be generated at higher Fletching levels. Alternatively, it can be extremely fast with more expensive methods.

There is a spinning wheel on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of the house north of the churchyard. Spinning flax gives 15 [[Crafting]] experience, and requires level 10 Crafting. Using the spinning wheel on the {{FloorNumber|uk=1}} of [[Lumbridge Castle]] is a favourite among players because of its proximity to the [[bank]] on the floor above.

==Making the items==
===Weapons===
====Bows====
To fletch bows, a player must use a [[knife]] on a log to whittle a short bow or long bow of that wood. Then, [[bow string]] must be attached to the unstrung bow. Bows, especially [[Yew longbow]]s and [[Magic longbow]]s, are frequently [[High Alchemy|high alched]] as a means of income.

====Unstrung====
{{Table/Fletching/Unstrung bows}}

====Strung====
{{Table/Fletching/Bows}}

====Crossbows====
To fletch crossbows, a player must make a [[crossbow stock]] out of a log using a [[knife]]. Then, [[crossbow limbs]] must be added using a [[hammer]]. Finally, a [[crossbow string]] must be added to the [[unstrung crossbow]].

{{Table/Fletching/Crossbows}}

====Ballistae====
{{Table/Fletching/Ballistae}}

====Battlestaff====
{{Table/Fletching/Battlestaff}}

===Shields===
To fletch shields, players must have at least two logs in the inventory. The shields are used as the base for [[leather shield]]s, which require [[Crafting]] levels to make.

Fletching the wooden shields grants the same amount of Fletching experience as fletching a full longbow of the same level.

{{Table/Fletching/Shields}}

===Projectiles===
====Arrows====
To fletch arrows, use a [[knife]] on [[logs]] to create [[arrow shafts]]. Each log yields a variable amount of arrow shafts. Add [[feather]]s and arrow heads.

The following table shows experience per item made, although 15 items are made at a time:

{{Table/Fletching/Arrows}}

====Ogre arrows====
[[Achey logs]] can be whittled into [[Ogre arrow]] shafts. Each achey log yields between two and six arrow shafts. Four [[feather]]s are needed for each shaft. The shafts may be tipped with [[wolf bones|wolf bone]] arrow heads or with [[nail]]s. Ogre shafts tipped with nails are called "[[Brutal arrows|brutals]]" and are especially useful for killing [[Zogre]]s. Any type of metal may be used for the nails.

{{Table/Fletching/Ogre arrows}}

====Bolts====
[[Bolts]] are the standard ammunition for [[Crossbow (weapon)|crossbows]]. They are created by combining [[unfinished bolts]] with [[feather]]s. One feather is consumed for every unfinished bolt and finished bolts are created in stacks of 10.

{{Table/Fletching/Bolts}}

====Tipped bolts====
Finished bolts can be improved by adding bolt tips to them. For example, [[Sapphire bolt tips]] can be attached to [[Mithril bolts]] to create [[Sapphire bolts]]. Improved bolts can be enchanted using the [[Enchant Crossbow Bolt]] spell.

{{Table/Fletching/Tipped bolts}}

====Tipped dragon bolts====
[[Dragon bolts]] are unique in that they can tipped with any type of [[bolt tip]], except [[Barb bolttips|barbed]] and [[Amethyst bolt tips|amethyst]].

{{Table/Fletching/Tipped dragon bolts}}

====Bolt tips====
[[Bolt tips]] are also created through the Fletching skill. By using a [[chisel]] on a cut [[gem]], the player is able to create 12 bolt tips. [[Pearls]] are an exception, as they yield either 6 or 24 depending on the type of pearl used.

{{Table/Fletching/Bolt tips}}

====Kebbit bolts====
[[Kebbit bolts]] are exclusively used with the [[Hunter's crossbow]]. They are made by using a [[chisel]] on [[kebbit spike]]s and [[long kebbit spike]]s.

{{Table/Fletching/Kebbit bolts}}

====Grapples====
[[Mith grapple]]s are used in the [[Agility]] skill to pass specific [[Shortcuts|obstacles]].

{{Table/Fletching/Mith grapple}}

====Darts====
You can fletch [[dart]]s by adding [[feather]]s to a smithed dart.

{{Table/Fletching/Darts}}

====Javelin====
[[Javelin]]s are made by attaching [[javelin heads]] to [[javelin shafts]].

[[File:Herblore icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Herblore''' is a [[members]]-only [[skill]] that allows players to make their own [[potions]] from [[herb]]s and various secondary ingredients.

Potions created with the Herblore skill have a variety of effects. Most potions can be drunk to give players [[temporary skill boost]]s or other status effects, such as [[anti-fire]] or [[anti-poison]]. Effects of temporary skill boosts degrade at roughly 1 level per minute until they have entirely worn off.

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Herblore level up - with unlocks
|filename = Herblore level up (with unlocks).ogg
|desc = The music that plays when levelling up and unlocking new content.}}

==Requirements==
Training Herblore or obtaining a temporary boost requires completion of the [[Druidic Ritual]] quest. Upon completing this quest, players are rewarded with 250 Herblore experience, granting them level 3 in Herblore. From level 3 onwards, players will be able to train Herblore by creating potions.

==Training activities==
There are roughly four methods to train Herblore: by cleaning [[herbs]], making [[potions]], adding herbs to [[swamp tar]] and making [[Barbarian Training#Barbarian Herblore|barbarian potions]].

===Cleaning herbs &amp; unfinished potions===
Cleaning [[herbs]] is a simple task you have to perform before you can add a herb to a [[vial of water]] to create an [[Unfinished potion (disambiguation)|unfinished potion]].

''For information about the cost/profit on cleaning herbs or creating unfinished potions, see [[Calculator:Herblore/Herbs]]''

===Potions===
Potions act as a [[Temporary skill boost|temporary skill boost.]] Once you add a [[herb]] to a [[vial of water]], you get an [[Unfinished potion (disambiguation)|unfinished potion]]; then, you must add a secondary ingredient to finish the potion completely. A newly finished vial of potion contains three (3) doses of the potion. Some higher-level potions require a vial of [[coconut milk]] to be used instead of water.

Wearing an [[amulet of chemistry]] gives a 5% chance of creating a four (4) dose potion instead. This can be useful for conserving resources on [[Ironman Mode|Ironman accounts]] or for potions with rare or expensive ingredients.

''For information about the cost per experience, see [[Calculator:Herblore/Potions]]''

===Barbarian Mixes===
{{Main|Barbarian Herblore}}
Barbarian potions can be made by adding [[roe]] or [[caviar]] to two-dose potions. The barbarian potions will hold two doses that give the same effect as their regular counterparts, as well as restore 3 to 6 [[Hitpoints]] per dose.

Each potion must be mixed individually, there is no ''make-all'' option, making it much more focus intensive. Additionally, the default ''left-click'' option for [[roe]] and [[caviar]] is ''"eat"'', not ''"use"'', making it possible to consume the ingredients instead of using them.

===Ingredient Processing===
Herblore often requires time consuming actions that do not reward experience such as crushing raw ingredients or making unfinished potions. Some NPCs offer services that can complete these processes on many items at once and save players time.
====Crushing====
*[[Wesley]] in Nardah will crush noted ingredients for {{Coins|50}} each.
====Mixing====
*[[Zahur]] in Nardah will combine noted vials of water and herbs to create unfinished potions for {{Coins|200}} each. ''(Requires completion of the hard desert diary, or a herblore cape)''
====Cleaning Grimy Herbs====
*[[Zahur]] in Nardah will clean grimy (un-noted) herbs for {{Coins|200}} each.
**After completing the hard desert diary she will clean noted herbs as well.
====Decanting====
The following NPCs can help you combine or seperate your potions into 1-dose, 2-dose, 3-dose or 4-dose items instead.
*[[Zahur]] in Nardah will decant potions for free.
*[[Bob barter]] at the GE will decant potions for free.

==Temporary boosts==
{{main|Temporary skill boost}}
Herblore cannot be boosted before completing Druidic Ritual; attempting to use such an item will consume it and give the message "''Your lack of Herblore experience prevents you from gaining any further bonus.''"

[[File:Hitpoints icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Hitpoints''' (also known as "health" or "HP", "Hits" in ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', or "Constitution" in ''{{RSL|RuneScape 3}}'') represent a player's health. If they reach zero, the player will [[Death|die]]. Hitpoints is the only skill for which players start at level ten on [[Tutorial Island]], where the player starts out with exactly 1,154 [[experience]] points.

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Hitpoints level up - levels 11-49
|filename = Hitpoints level up (levels 2-49).ogg
|desc = The music that plays when achieving levels 11-49.}}

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Hitpoints level up - levels 50-99
|filename = Hitpoints level up (levels 50-99).ogg
|desc = The music that plays when achieving levels 50-99.}}

==Fighting==
While fighting, both the opponent and the player will have a bar over them. This bar represents their Hitpoints.

[[File:Healthbar slider.gif|Healthbar slider.gif]]

There are two colours on the bar, green and red. The green part of the bar represents how many Hitpoints a character has left, and the red part represents how many Hitpoints they are missing, i.e. the net damage they have suffered. So if a player is low on Hitpoints, then the bar over them would be mostly red, meaning they are near death. Players often refer to "being redbarred" when barely surviving or only just getting a kill for this reason.

==Recovering hitpoints==
A player can heal to restore their hitpoints up to, or occasionally even above their maximum. There's a number of ways to do this.

===Regeneration===
Players naturally regenerate '''1 hitpoint every minute'''. This can be boosted with the following effects.
*The [[Rapid Heal]] [[Prayer]] or the [[Hitpoints cape]] cause natural healing to double, healing an additional 1 hitpoint per minute. ''These effects do not stack with each other''.
**The [[Regen bracelet]] doubles the amount of health restored by natural healing. This can stack with either of the above effects to increase natural healing to 4 Hitpoints per minute.
*The Lunar spell [[Dream]] incapacitates the player but increases regeneration by an additional 3 hitpoints per minute.

===Restoration===
{{main|food}}
*[[Food]] is the most common and reliable method of restoring Hitpoints. Food can restore large amounts of health quickly and cheaply.
**Because of how important food is, unlocking access to stronger tiers of food is often considered significant milestones in a character's progress.

*[[Saradomin brew]] when used carefully can restore more health per slot than food, but have unique drawbacks to be considered. They are often used where inventory space or sustainability is a concern.

====Situational====
*The monks at the [[Edgeville Monastery]] will heal players if they ask them. They heal eight Hitpoints each time.
*The nurses at the [[Emir's Arena]] hospital will heal players if asked.
*The [[Elidinis Statuette]] in [[Nardah]] will fully restore a player's Prayer points, completely heal them, completely restore their run energy and special attack energy, cure poison and give a temporary Hitpoints boost depending on the player's Hitpoints level. Players who have completed the [[Elite Desert Diary]] can take advantage of the [[desert amulet 4]], which provides unlimited [[Nardah]] teleports and teleports the player close to the statue. It is also directly south of a [[Fairy ring]] ({{Fairycode|dlq}}). This statue can only be used after [[Spirits of the Elid]] is complete.
*Drinking from an [[ornate rejuvenation pool]] in a player-owned house, or a [[pools of refreshment|pool of refreshment]] at the Ferox Enclave will fully restore all hitpoints.

====Items====
*[[Phoenix necklace]]s automatically restore the wearer's Hitpoints by 30% of their maximum if their Hitpoints drop below 20% of their maximum.

==Life Leech==
{{main|Life leech}}
The following methods can provide a percentage of damage dealt as Hitpoints restoration, commonly referred to as life leech.

Life leech can occur actively through some [[special attacks]] or more passively through chance on-hit effects.
{{:Life leech/Sources}}

==Damaging oneself==
Players can damage themselves with some interactions with the following items. Non-lethal items cannot kill you under normal circumstances (they will simply not deal their damage if it would be lethal, or the item is not allowed to be used), while lethal items can. Damage from non-lethal items may still result in death if it is taken at the same time as damage from another source.

===Non-lethal===
*[[Cave nightshade]]
*[[Chemical compound]]
*[[Divine potion]]s
*[[Dwarven rock cake]]
*[[Explosive potion]] ([[Explosive_potion_(Soul_Wars)|Soul wars]]) ([[Explosive_potion_(Song_of_the_Elves)|Song of the elves]])
*[[Locator orb]]
*[[Mixed chemicals]]
*[[Nitroglycerin]]
*[[Overload]] (all variants) 
*[[Poison chalice]]
*[[Poison karambwan]]
*[[Rock cake]]
*[[Zamorak brew]]
*[[Ground bat bones]] combined with [[Guam potion (unf)]]

===Lethal===
*[[Enchanted symbol]]
*[[Strange device]]
*[[Lit strange object]]

==Death==
{{Main|Death}}
When a player's Hitpoints reach zero, they [[Death|die]], dropping all the [[items]] in their inventory on the ground except their three most valuable [[items]] (based on [[Grand Exchange]] values). One more item can be saved if a player dies with the [[Protect Item]] [[Prayer]] activated. Outside of [[PvP]] areas, items dropped on death are only visible to the player who owned them and remain on the ground or in the gravestone for fifteen minutes, after which they will be transferred to Death's Office; within such areas, they remain on the ground for only two minutes and are visible only to the killer during the first minute.

If a player attacks another player in the [[Wilderness]] who hasn't engaged in [[combat]] with them first, or has entered the [[Abyss]] via the [[Mage of Zamorak]], a [[Skull (status)|skull]] appears over their head. If a player under any circumstances dies while "skulled," they drop '''all''' the items in their inventory - unless the Protect Item Prayer is used, allowing the player to keep a single item if they die (unless the player is in a [[High-risk server|high-risk world]]). A skull obtained by attacking another player will disappear if the player waits twenty minutes without performing any actions that would cause them to get another skull, while a skull caused by entering the Abyss will disappear after ten minutes, provided the same condition is fulfilled.

A [[ring of life]] can be used to automatically [[Teleportation|teleport]] the player safely back to their respawn point if they take a hit which causes them to fall to or below 10% of their maximum Hitpoints. Note that a ring of life '''will not''' activate if the player is hit with a blow that kills them from above 10% of their Hitpoints or if they are in level 30 Wilderness or deeper.

There are a few "safe" areas where if a player dies, they will not lose any of their items:
*[[Pest Control]]
*[[Castle Wars]]
*[[Nightmare Zone]]
*Inside a [[player-owned house]]
*Duelling with another player inside the [[Emir's Arena]]
*[[TzHaar Fight Cave]]/[[TzHaar Fight Pit|Pit]]
*[[Clan Wars]]
*[[Zulrah]]
*[[Vorkath]]
*[[Grotesque Guardians]]

===Respawning===
When a player dies, they will [[Spawning|respawn]] in one of seven possible locations. The default location is [[Lumbridge]], but [[members]] can unlock six more locations by completing certain actions and have one active at a time:

*[[Falador]]: Can be unlocked after completing the [[Recruitment Drive]] [[quest]], by talking to [[Sir Tiffy Cashien]] in [[Falador Park]].
*[[Camelot]]: Can be unlocked after completing the [[Camelot training room]] [[Minigames|minigame]], by talking to [[Merlin]].
*[[Edgeville]] cemetery: Can be unlocked by paying [[Krystilia]] a one-time fee of 5,000,000 [[coins]].
*[[Prifddinas]]: Can be unlocked by talking to [[Crefydd]] after completing [[Song of the Elves]].
*[[Ferox Enclave|Ferox Enclave:]] Can be unlocked by paying [[Ferox]] a one-time fee of 5,000,000 [[coins]].
*[[Kourend Castle]]: Can be unlocked by completing the [[A Kingdom Divided]] quest and talking to [[Asteros Arceuus]].

==Earning experience==
To earn [[experience]] in Hitpoints, a player has to fight, complete [[quests]] which reward Hitpoints experience or rub experience lamps.

When fighting, be it [[Melee]], [[Ranged]], or [[Magic]], a player will earn Hitpoints experience whenever damage is dealt. For every hitpoint of damage dealt, 1.33 experience points are given to the player's Hitpoints. However, a few monsters give greatly reduced experience due to their ability to regenerate (an exception to this being [[Monkey Guard]]s from [[Ape Atoll]]).

==Trivia==
*In ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', all players started with level ten Hits and 1,000 experience - slightly fewer experience than would be required for level ten in all other skills. When ''[[RuneScape 2]]'' was released, accounts that had not gained the Hits experience needed to reach level ten or higher had their Hitpoints stat "corrected" to level nine. The only way to have level nine Hitpoints was to have created an account prior to the release of ''RuneScape 2'' and not to have trained the Hitpoints skill since. The minimum [[combat level]] is still three for those players. However, since all accounts in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' start fresh, no player in ''OSRS'' has nine Hitpoints.
*Also in ''RSC'', botters and rulebreakers were punished by having all their stats reset to one, resulting in a Hits level of one. This created level one accounts, which still exist in ''{{RSL|RuneScape 3}}'' today.

'''Hunter''' is a [[members-only]] [[skill]] in which players catch different [[Hunter creatures|animals and creatures]] in ''[[RuneScape]]''. Although Hunter is a non-[[combat]] skill, players can still be damaged while hunting. Using hunting equipment bought from [[hunter stores]], players can hunt specific creatures obtaining rewards such as [[spotted kebbit fur]] for [[spotted cape]], [[chinchompa]]s, [[black salamander]]s, and the fabled [[dragon impling]]s.

Released in November 2006, it is the most recent skill added to ''Old School Runescape''.

==Hunter areas==
There are a couple designated Hunter areas that form a habitat housing multiple [[Hunter creatures]]. These habitats are a desert, jungle, woodland and a snowy area. These Hunter areas are not the only locations in [[Gielinor]] that house Hunter creatures. There are also several other locations housing a single species.

After completion of the [[Eagle's Peak]] quest, a player can use the [[eagle transport system]] to fly an eagle from Eagles' Peak in the woodland area to three of the other training areas: snow, jungle and desert.

==Hunting techniques==
===Aerial fishing===
{{Main|Aerial fishing}}

Aerial fishing is a Hunter technique requiring 35 Hunter and 43 [[Fishing]]. The aerial fishing technique is used to catch several [[fish]] species at [[Lake Molch]]. With the required Hunter and Fishing level and a [[cormorant's glove]] equipped, clicking on a fishing spot will send the cormorant towards the spot to catch a fish. The cormorant will always return to the player with a fish.

===Bird house trapping===
[[File:Magic bird house detail.png|right|100px]]
{{Main|Bird house trapping}}

The bird house trapping technique is used to catch birds on [[Fossil Island]]. With the required Hunter level, the player may set up a bird house and fill it with seeds and wait approximately 50 minutes for it to fill up with birds. The player may then check the bird houses, from which they will receive Hunter experience, [[feather]]s, [[raw bird meat]] and a [[bird nest]]s. The bird house will be lost in the process, but the clockwork will be returned.

===Bird snaring===
{{Main|Bird snare}}

The bird snaring technique is used to catch several [[Bird (disambiguation)|birds]]. With the required Hunter level, the player may set up a bird snare and wait for a bird to approach the trap.

===Box trapping===
{{Main|Box trap}}

The box trapping technique is used to catch [[ferret]]s and [[Chinchompa (disambiguation)|chinchompa]]s. With the required Hunter level and completion of the [[Eagles' Peak]] quest, the player may set up a box trap. When a chinchompa or ferret passes the trap, it may be caught, but only when the player is not standing on the trap.

===Butterfly netting===
[[File:Butterfly net detail.png|right|100px]]
{{Main|Butterfly net}}

The butterfly netting technique is used to catch [[butterfly (Hunter)|butterflies]], [[impling]]s and bats. With the required Hunter level, a [[butterfly net]] (or [[magic butterfly net]]) and the appropriate container (a [[Butterfly jar|butterfly]] or [[impling jar]]), the player may left-click on a flying creature to capture it.

===Deadfall trapping===
{{Main|Deadfall}}

The deadfall trapping technique is used to catch [[Kebbit (disambiguation)|kebbit]]s and [[Maniacal monkey (Hunter)|maniacal monkey]]s. With the required Hunter level, a [[knife]] and [[logs]] in the inventory (or a [[banana]] when hunting maniacal monkeys), clicking on a boulder will set the trap. When the kebbit or monkey paths towards the trap, it may be caught.

===Drift net fishing===
{{Main|Drift net fishing}}

The drift net fishing technique is used to catch [[fish shoal]]s. With the required Hunter and [[Fishing]] level, and a [[drift net]] in the inventory, clicking on the drift net anchors will set the trap. When a [[fish shoal]] swims towards the net, it may get stuck in the net. The player can choose to actively chase the fish shoals to speed up the process. A [[merfolk trident]] gives an increased chance to scare off fish shoals into the net.

If ten fish shoals get stuck in the trap, the net will be full, and the player will have the option to "check" the drift net. This will reward the player with ten raw fish.

===Falconry===
{{Main|Falconry}}

The falconry technique is used to catch several [[kebbit]]s. With the required Hunter level and a [[gyr falcon]], clicking on a kebbit will send the falcon towards the kebbit. When the falcon catches the kebbit, the hunter needs to retrieve both the falcon and the drops.

===Implings===
[[File:Dragon impling jar detail.png|right|100px]]
{{Main|Impling}}

[[Implings]] are small creatures that can be hunted within [[Puro-Puro]] as well as spawning at random points around the world. Catching an Impling requires the use of a [[butterfly net]] or [[magic butterfly net]] and an [[impling jar]]. Alternatively, implings can be caught barehanded - without the use of a net or impling jar - although this requires a Hunter level of 10 levels above the normal requirement.

===Net trapping===
{{Main|Net trap}}

The net trapping technique is used to catch [[salamander]]s. With the required Hunter level, a [[rope]] and [[small fishing net]] in the inventory, clicking on a [[young tree]] will set the trap. When the lizard or salamander passes the trap, it may be caught, but only when the player is not standing on the net.

===Magic box trapping===
{{Main|Magic box}}

The magic box trapping technique is used to catch [[imp]]s. With the required Hunter level, the player may set up a magic box. When an imp passes the trap, it may be caught, but only when the player is not standing on the trap.

===Pitfall trapping===
{{Main|Pitfall}}

The pitfall trapping technique is used to catch [[spined larupia]]s, [[horned graahk]]s and [[sabre-toothed kyatt]]s. With the required Hunter level, a [[knife]] and [[logs]] in the inventory, clicking on a pit will set the trap. With a [[teasing stick]] in the inventory, the player has to tease the creature and then jump over the spiked pit. When the creature passes the trap, it may be caught.

===Rabbit snaring===
{{Main|Rabbit snare}}

The rabbit snaring technique is used to catch [[white rabbit]]s. With the required Hunter level, completion of the [[Eagles' Peak]] quest and a [[ferret]] in the inventory, the player may set up a rabbit snare and flush a [[rabbit hole]] to trap a white rabbit.

===Tracking===
[[File:Herbiboar.png|right|100px]]
{{Main|Tracking}}

The tracking technique is used to catch several [[Kebbit (disambiguation)|kebbit]]s and [[herbiboar]]s. With this technique the player inspects scenery objects in the creature's habitat to uncover a creature's tracks. These tracks will eventually lead the player towards the hiding creature. When the hiding creature is found, right-click 'Attack' while wielding a [[noose wand]] to receive loot and experience. A noose wand is not needed to catch herbiboar.

==Miscellaneous==
===Bait and smoking traps===
There are three ways for player to increase the catch rate of creatures: a higher skill level, using bait and smoking the trap. Many [[Hunter creatures]] have a preferred bait that players can use on a trap to increase the catch rate. To find out what the preferred bait of a creature is, visit the creature's page or the in-game Hunter guide. By smoking a trap, the player's scent will vanish, and thus make the creature less suspicious of the trap. A trap can be smoked by using a lit [[torch]] on the trap.

Adding bait to a trap will increase the catch rate by +3%, while smoking a trap will increase the catch rate by +2%.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/793829284288851968|date=2 November 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/MBH14|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=+2% for the smoke, +3% for the bait.}} Due to the low increase of the catch rate, most players believe that smoking or adding bait to traps doesn't justify the extra actions it takes.

===Multiple traps===
Box trapping, net trapping, bird snaring and rabbit snaring can be done with multiple traps at once, with the maximum amount of traps depending on the player's Hunter level.

An extra trap may be set while hunting [[Black salamander (Hunter)|black salamander]]s or [[Black chinchompa (Hunter)|black chinchompa]]s in the [[wilderness]]. 

Temporary boosts make it possible to use more traps at lower levels.

===Hunter shops===
There are two [[Hunter stores]] in which players can buy hunter tools. These shops are [[Aleck's Hunter Emporium.]] in [[Yanille]] and [[Nardah Hunter Shop]] in [[Nardah]]. Both shops have the same items in stock.

===Hunter spell===
Casting the [[Hunter Kit (spell)|Hunter Kit spell]] on the [[Lunar spells|Lunar spellbook]], requiring level 71 [[Magic]] and [[Dream Mentor]], players will obtain a [[hunter kit]] which contains various useful hunter tools: a [[bird snare]], [[box trap]], [[butterfly net]], [[impling jar]], [[noose wand]], [[rabbit snare]], [[teasing stick]] and [[Torch|unlit torch]].

===Hunter crossbow===
[[File:Hunters' crossbow detail.png|right|100px]]
[[Leon]], who is located inside the Hunter shop in [[Yanille]], sells a [[hunter's crossbow]] for 1,300 coins. This crossbow possesses a firing speed of 4, which is equivalent to that of a [[Shortbow (weapon)|shortbow]], requires 50 [[Ranged]] to wield and can only use [[kebbit bolts]] and [[long kebbit bolts]] as ammunition.

Players can make their own bolts using the [[Fletching]] skill by using a [[chisel]] on a kebbit spike, or they can pay Leon a small fee to makes the bolts for them.
*6 [[Kebbit bolts]] costs a [[kebbit spike]] ([[Prickly kebbit]]) and 20 coins
*6 [[long kebbit bolts]] cost a [[long kebbit spike]] ([[Razor-backed kebbit]]) and 40 coins

===Hunter and camouflage clothing===
{{Main|Fancy Clothes Store}}
[[File:Custom Fur Clothing.png|right|400x400px]]
Some Hunter creatures will reward the player with the creature's fur when caught. These furs may be traded in at the [[Fancy Clothes Store]] in south-east [[Varrock]] for different types of [[hunter gear]]. In addition to the furs, the costume maker will also charge a small fee to create this gear.
*[[Polar camouflage gear]] - [[Polar kebbit fur]]
*[[Wood camouflage gear]] - [[Common kebbit fur]]
*[[Jungle camouflage gear]] - [[Feldip weasel fur]]
*[[Desert camouflage gear]] - [[Desert devil fur]]
*[[Larupia hunter gear]] - [[Larupia fur]] and [[tatty larupia fur]]
*[[Graahk hunter gear]] - [[Graahk fur]] and [[tatty graahk fur]]
*[[Kyatt hunter gear]] - [[Kyatt fur]] and [[tatty kyatt fur]]

Wearing camouflage gear does not improve the chance of successfully capturing creatures and is therefore purely cosmetic.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/570364523552509952|date=24 February 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ZRz6J|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=[Does any hunter gear work?] Nope.}}

The costume maker can also make a few other items. [[Spotted cape|Spotted]] and [[spottier cape]]s reduce the player's weight when worn, and the [[gloves of silence]] made from dark kebbit furs make pickpocketing easier.

==Hunter pets==
===Baby chinchompa===
[[File:Baby Chinchompa (grey).png|right|90px]]
{{Main|Baby chinchompa}}
The [[baby chinchompa]] is a skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained while catching any kind of [[Chinchompa (disambiguation)|chinchompa]]. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Hunter level and the type of chinchompa being hunted.

===Herbi===
[[File:Herbi (follower).png|right|85px]]
{{Main|Herbi}}
[[Herbi]] is a [[pet]] obtained from hunting [[herbiboar]]s found in [[Fossil Island]]'s [[Mushroom Forest]]. There is a 1/6,500 chance to receive the pet after the player harvests the herbs from the herbiboar.

'''Skilling outfits''' increase the [[experience]] gained in a specific [[skill]] or provide other skill-boosting benefits when worn. These items can be obtained in a number of ways. For skills that have an experience-boosting set, when every part of the set is worn, it provides a 2.5% experience boost. This boost does not apply to certain experience rewards, such as [[quest experience rewards]] or finishing a round of [[Wintertodt]] or a [[Mahogany Homes]] contract.

'''Magic''' is one of the most important [[skills]] in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' and is one of the three [[combat classes]]. It is used in [[combat]] via [[combat spells]], fast transport around the world via [[teleportation spells]], and allows [[Crafting|crafted]] [[items]] to be enchanted and convert items into [[coins]] through [[utility spells]]. While it is possible to play the game without being skilled in Magic, it is a considerable advantage to be able to use many [[spells]], especially High Level Alchemy and teleports.

Magic is also important in order to defend well against Magic attacks. Unlike [[Melee Defence|Melee]] and [[Ranged Defence]], a player's [[Magic Defence]] is actually determined by both Magic (70%) and [[Defence]] (30%) levels, as well as magic defence bonus.

==Spells==
{{Otheruses|def=no|a list of all the spells in the game|List of spells}}
[[File:Magic demo.gif|frame|A player demonstrating Magic [[spells]].]]
Magic is used almost exclusively through casting spells on [[monsters]], another player, on one's self (reflexively), or on an [[item]].

Magic spells are divided into three distinct types: Combat, Teleport, and Utility spells.

===Combat spells===
{{Main|Combat spells}}
Combat spells are primarily used by players, mostly in battle, for their offensive capabilities. Combat spells can be separated into three sub-types:
* Offensive spells - Used to deal magical damage against opponents.
* Curse spells - Used to disable or debilitate an opponent.
* Support spells - Offers a range of benefits to the caster or recipient.

===Teleport spells===
{{Main|Teleport spells}}
Teleport spells instantly transport players to a predetermined location. As [[teleportation]] save lots of time when travelling around the world, they are widely used among all players.

Some spells may teleport players to the dangerous [[Wilderness]], where they are warned before the spell is actually cast, though this can be toggled by right-clicking the spell icon.

===Utility spells===
{{Main|Utility spells}}
Utility spells are primarily used by players outside of combat in [[skilling]] activities, such as enchanting jewellery, baking [[pie]]s, or reanimating [[ensouled head]]s.

The [[Lunar spellbook]], accessible by [[members]], focuses heavily on utility spells.

==Runes==
{{Main|Runes}}
All spells (with the exception of the [[Home Teleport]]s) require the use of [[runes]] as a consumed resource. Runes are stackable, commonly traded items which are obtained by various methods, such as by crafting them via the [[Runecraft]] skill or obtained as drops from monsters.

===Elemental staves===
{{Main|Elemental staves}}
The requirement for certain [[runes]] in a spell can be removed if the player wields an [[elemental staff]] corresponding to an elemental rune. As an example, wielding a [[staff of fire]] allows a player to cast [[High Level Alchemy]] using only one [[nature rune]].

===Magic weapons===
{{Main|Weapons#Magic}}

Magic weapons attack from a distance and come in two primary types, [[staves]] and [[wand]]s. They can be used as melee weapons, however their primary function is for casting spells, taking place of [[elemental]] [[rune]]s, [[auto cast]], and access to specific spells like [[Magic Dart]].

==Spellbooks==
There are four different spellbooks used to cast magic spells from. A player may only cast spells from their current spellbook, and if they wish to use spells from another spellbook, they must change to that spellbook through various means.

To cast a [[spell]], a player must choose the desired spell from their spellbook. To access the activated spellbook, click on the spellbook icon in the game's [[interface]].

[[Free-to-play]] players only have access to the [[standard spellbook]], while the other three spellbooks are only available for [[members]] after unlocking them through various content.

As with other [[skills]], some spells require higher skill levels to cast.

===Standard spellbook===
{{main|Standard spellbook}}
[[File:Standard spellbook.png|left|The standard spellbook icon.]]
The standard spellbook is available to all players. There is no prerequisite to using the standard spellbook, although some spells are only available on members' worlds and others require completion of certain [[quests]] or tasks. 

===Arceuus spellbook===
{{main|Arceuus spellbook}}
[[File:Arceuus spellbook.png|left|The Arceuus spellbook icon.]]
The Arceuus spellbook is available to players upon gaining 60% [[favour]] with the city of [[Arceuus]]. Like the [[standard spellbook]], it has a variety of teleport and utility spells at its disposal, although a larger set of combat and utility spells are only accessible to players who have completed the quest [[A Kingdom Divided]].

===Ancient Magicks===
{{main|Ancient Magicks}}
[[File:Ancient spellbook.png|left|The Ancient Magicks icon.]]
Ancient Magicks are available to players upon completion of the quest [[Desert Treasure I]]. Unlike the other spellbooks, the Ancient Magicks is significantly combat-oriented, including some of the most powerful combat spells in the game.

===Lunar spellbook===
{{main|Lunar spellbook}}
[[File:Lunar spellbook.png|left|The lunar spellbook icon.]]
The Lunar spellbook is available to players upon completion of the quest [[Lunar Diplomacy]]. The spellbook is primarily oriented towards utility spells and combat-support spells, although some of them are only accessible to players who have completed the quest [[Dream Mentor]] and completion of the [[Hard Fremennik Diary]].

==Combat==
===Monster magic defence===
A monster's defence level has no effect on the accuracy of incoming magical attacks. Instead, a monster's magical defence roll is calculated solely from their magic level and magic defence bonus. This differs from range and melee, as they use the defence level and respective defence bonus.{{NamedRef|tweet}}

===Magic staves===
{{Main|Staves}}
Various [[staves]] are available in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''. In the list below are all the [[free-to-play]] staves, which all can be obtained at [[Zaff]]'s store in [[Varrock]]. The main effect of a staff is to boost Magic Attack and [[Defence]], while the [[elemental staves]] provide unlimited amounts of their corresponding [[Runes|rune(s)]]. There are many [[members]]' staves such as [[battlestaves]], [[mystic staves]], [[slayer's staff]], [[lunar staff]] and [[ancient staff]]. Visit the staves' page for a complete description.

===Magic armour and robes===
{{Main|Armour/Magic armour|l1=Armour}}
Most mages wear [[robes]], although some light armour is available that is made from special material and does not hinder the wearer's ability to perform magical attacks. For the different sets of armour and detailed information on each piece, see the [[Magic armour|armour guide]].

A player can have a Magic Attack bonus of [[Armour/Highest bonuses#Magic|up to 172]], and a Magic Defence bonus [[Armour/Highest bonuses#Magic 2|up to 253]]. The lowest Magic Attack bonus is -105, which will help prevent [[spells]] from hitting an opponent while training (i.e. [[splashing]]).

===Magic accuracy===
* There is no difference in magic accuracy between spells; higher-leveled spells are as equally accurate as lower-leveled spells. An exception to this is the accuracy bonus provided by [[Demonbane spells|Demonbane]] spells.
* Magic accuracy is solely determined by the attacker's Attack roll and the defender's Defence roll.
* The Attack roll and Defence roll formulas are different for monsters and players; their Attack and Defence effective levels differ.
*'''The player's accuracy roll''' depends on the player's Magic level (&lt;math&gt;M_{lvl}&lt;/math&gt;) and Magic equipment attack bonus (&lt;math&gt;M_{eab}&lt;/math&gt;).{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/jagexash/status/487514220829761536|date=11 July 2014|archiveurl=https://archive.is/BMSgJ|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=Your magic accuracy is calculated off your Magic stat (and equipment bonuses) so all spells get more accurate.}} Because visible Magic level is used, Prayer effects need to be considered (&lt;math&gt;P_{e}&lt;/math&gt;).

===Skill choice===
Upon completing any of the following quests, players may choose to allocate experience to Magic. These rewards usually come in the form of items, such as lamps or books, and are independent of any experience rewards directly received for completing the quest.
{{SkillChoice|Magic}}

==Trivia==
*In early 2001, there were two magic skills, Good Magic and Evil Magic. However, with the introduction of a new magic system, the lower skill was removed, and the higher skill changed to Magic. For example, if the player had level 50 Good Magic and level 40 Evil Magic, they would keep level 50 Magic, and the experience for the Evil Magic was discarded. Because of this, some players were upset that they lost money for training their lower magic skill, and that the experience was thrown away instead of carried over. There were also spells like Shock Bolt, Elemental Bolt, Camouflage, and Fear.
*Prior to the introduction of ''RuneScape 2'', [[combat spells]] were universally represented by a simple, flying blue star, which proved difficult to distinguish from [[arrows]], which were green stars. Also, in ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', players were capable of casting magic spells while wearing full [[rune armour]], leading to a massive imbalance in favour of high-level mages.
*Prior to the advent of [[multicombat area]]s in ''RuneScape 2'', mages and [[Ranged|archers]] could attack enemies while a [[melee]] fighter engaged the [[monster]] in direct [[combat]]. This was the most common way for multiple players to attack the same creature, usually high level bosses like the [[King Black Dragon]]. The loot would go to whoever dealt the most damage, and the person who dealt the last hit would be the only one to receive [[experience]], though less than if they had killed the monster themselves.
*In ''RuneScape Classic'', each spell gave the fixed experience using the formula 2 * spell level + 20. Magic was a much faster skill to train if you could get sufficient [[runes]], though runes were much harder to obtain. With ''RuneScape 2'' came the introduction of [[Runecraft]] and many monsters with much higher rune drop rates, so runes became much easier to obtain. Accordingly, experience rates were also reduced to where they are today. Now normal spells generally gives (spell level + 10) experience and combat spells generally give a base experience of (spell level + 10)/2.
*A ''Runescape Mythbusters'' episode aired on twitch revealed that a player's Magic level plays a role in defending against magic attacks.

'''Skill mastery''' is achieved by reaching '''level 99''' in a skill. 13,034,431 [[experience]] points are needed in a skill to reach level 99.

Once players reach level 99 in a skill, special fireworks will appear in place of the regular set of fireworks usually seen when levelling up. Once players reach the max total level, a different set of fireworks will appear as well.

Players can purchase a [[Cape of Accomplishment]] for a skill after reaching level 99 in the skill, for a fee of 99,000 coins. All skill capes come with a corresponding hood and a special emote. Capes become trimmed if a player has two or more maxed levels.

'''Mining''' is a [[skill]] that allows players to obtain [[ores]] and [[gems]] from [[mining rocks|rocks]]. The higher a player's Mining level is the more likely they are to successfully extract ore. With ores, a player can then either smelt [[bars]] and make [[equipment]] using the [[Smithing]] skill or sell them for profit. Mining is one of the most popular skills in ''[[Old School RuneScape|RuneScape]]'' as many players try to earn a profit from the skill. Mining areas are identified with a regular pickaxe [[File:Mining site icon.png]] [[icon]], and [[mining shops]] are identified with a gold pickaxe [[File:Mining shop icon.png]] [[icon]] on the [[minimap]] and [[world map]].

==How to mine==
[[File:Mining.gif|frame|A player using a [[rune pickaxe]] to mine ores.]]
The player can click on [[rock]]s in a [[mine]] to mine them, as long as they are wielding a [[pickaxe]] or have one in their inventory. After mining for a short amount of time, the player will obtain an [[ore]] or a [[gemstone]], depending on the rock mined. Ores can be used for [[Smithing]], and gemstones for [[Crafting]]. Rocks cannot be mined with a full inventory.

Every mining cycle, there is a chance to succeed and obtain an ore. Using a higher-tier pickaxe can increase mining speed by reducing the time to the next mining cycle. The chance of success each cycle varies by ore and increases with the player's mining level.

==Pickaxes==
{{Main|Pickaxe}}
[[Pickaxe]]s, or "picks," are needed to mine [[mining rocks|rocks]]. They can be equipped as a [[weapon]], giving players one extra space in their [[inventory]]. However, pickaxes cannot be made using the [[Smithing]] [[skill]]. Pickaxes can be bought from either [[Nurmof]] in the [[Dwarven Mine]] or [[Tati]] in [[Keldagrim]], or from other players. [[Nurmof's Pickaxe Shop]] in the Dwarven Mine is labelled on the [[minimap]] as a gold pickaxe.

A player's Mining level determines the type of pickaxe they can mine with. Higher level pickaxes grant more frequent opportunities to obtain an ore from a [[rock]], but have no effect upon the chance of successfully doing so.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1188758467399618560|date=28 October 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/pAF0M|archivedate=16 May 2020|quote=Your level affects the chance of getting ore each time the game rolls; your pickaxe affects how often that happens.}}

==Other equipment==
Besides the [[pickaxes]] discussed above, the following items have some effect on mining:

*Parts of [[prospector outfit]] increase Mining experience rates.
*[[Varrock armour]] provides a 10% chance to mine two ores of certain types (depending on tier) simultaneously, giving experience for both ores.
*[[Mining cape]] provides a 5% chance of receiving an extra ore while mining ore up to adamantite, giving experience for both ores.
*[[Mining gloves]], [[Superior mining gloves]] and [[Expert mining gloves]] provide a chance that when mining certain ores, the rock will not be depleted.
*The [[bracelet of clay]] causes [[soft clay]] to be obtained from [[clay rocks]] rather than raw [[clay]], and doubles the yield from [[soft clay rocks]].
*The [[celestial ring]] provides an invisible +4 boost to the player's mining level. This boost does not allow the player to mine ore above their mining level. When charged with [[stardust]], it gives the player a 10% chance to obtain an extra ore from rocks up to [[Adamantite rocks|adamantite]].
*The [[elven signet]] offers a 10% chance to prevent the [[crystal pickaxe]] from consuming a charge when an ore is mined.
*The [[celestial signet]] combines the effects of the celestial ring and the elven signet.
*[[Coal bag]] can store up to 27 [[Coal]], possibly improving mining efficiency.
*[[Gem bag]] can store up to 60 uncut gems of each [[Sapphire]] to [[Dragonstone]], possibly improving efficiency when mining [[gem rocks]] or perhaps even in [[Motherlode Mine]].
*A charged [[amulet of glory]] increases the chances of randomly finding [[gems]] while mining from 1/256 to 1/86, if it has a minimum of 1 charge remaining. It also significantly boosts mining [[gem rocks]].
*[[Ring of wealth (i)]] doubles the chance to receive easy-elite [[clue geode]]s when in the [[Wilderness]].

==Mineable items==
Ores are obtained from the different types of rocks, usually found in [[mines]]. On the [[minimap]], mines are labelled with a grey pickaxe. The colour of a rock corresponds to the ore's colour.

When players click on a rock, they will hit it with their [[pickaxe]] and try to get the ore out. Higher level rocks such as [[Mithril rocks|mithril]] and [[Adamantite rocks|adamantite]] take longer to mine and may require some patience.

After the ore has been mined, the rock will turn grey for a while. Eventually the ore will [[Spawning|respawn]] and the rock will regain its colour. Players can only mine a rock when ore is available. Ore respawn times differ with the difficulty of the rock. For example, [[runite rocks]] take 12 minutes to respawn while [[iron rocks]] take about three seconds.

===Gems===
When mining, players have a 1/256 chance of rolling an uncut [[Gems|gem]] table ''instead'' of receiving an ore; this neither depletes the ore nor grants mining experience.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1227166090603778048|date=11 February 2020|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/nPo1I|archivedate=09 May 2020|quote=It adds a gem roll before each ore roll, and if you receive a gem you don't get the ore roll.}} Gems that can be found in rocks are [[uncut sapphire]]s, [[uncut emerald]]s, [[Uncut ruby|uncut rubies]] and [[uncut diamond]]s.

A player's chances of finding gems are increased to 1/86 when wearing a '''charged''' [[amulet of glory]].{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/830809149210521601|date=12 February 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/2BaHv|archivedate=18 June 2019|quote=1 / 86 rather than 1/256 for a gem.}}

===Geodes===
[[Clue geode]]s are rare rocks that can be found when mining in place of receiving an ore. Searching them will give players a [[clue scroll]] of the same difficulty as the geode given.

===Other===
* [[Barronite deposit]]s have a chance to be obtained when mining for [[barronite shards]].
* [[Crystal shards]] have a chance to be obtained alongside the main product of rocks in the [[Trahaearn Mine]].
* [[Iron ore fragment|Iron]], [[Silver ore fragment|silver]], [[Coal fragment|coal]], [[Gold ore fragment|gold]], [[Mithril ore fragment|mithril]], [[Adamantite ore fragment|adamantite]] and [[runite ore fragment]] are mined from the boulder in the [[Volcanic Mine]].
* [[Soda ash]] is occasionally obtained while mining [[ash pile]]s.
* [['perfect' gold ore]] can be obtained from the rocks in [[Witchaven Dungeon]]. They are used during the [[Family Crest]] quest but can still be mined and smelted after the quest is completed.
* A [[Magic stone (Tears of Guthix)|magic stone]] is mined during the [[Tears of Guthix]] quest. The area cannot be accessed again after the quest is completed.
* Various items can be obtained from [[Digsite]] digs.
* Various items can be otained by [[Panning tray|panning]], notably [[Nuggets|gold nuggets]].
* [[Tephra]] is mined while fighting [[Zalcano]].
* [[Rock (elemental)|Rocks]] can be mined from boulders in the [[Viyeldi Caves]] and [[Pile of Rock|piles of rock]], giving the player 1 experience.
* [[Daeyalt ore]] (not to be confused with [[daeyalt shard]]s) can be mined from [[daeyalt rocks]] in the [[Meiyerditch mine]] for 17.5 experience, requiring level 20 mining. 15 pieces must be placed in the minecart to escape the mine.
* [[Saltpetre]] can be obtained by digging deposits in [[Hosidius]] with a [[spade]]. Although it grants no experience, the amount obtained scales with mining level.
* [[Book page 3]] can be obtained randomly by mining most types of rock in the [[Dwarven Mines]] during [[Between a Rock...]]
* A grey [[Crystal (Watchtower)|crystal]] is obtained by mining the [[Rock of Dalgroth]] during the [[Watchtower]] quest, requiring level 40 mining.
* [[Lunar ore]] is mined from [[Lunar rock|stalagmites]] in the [[Lunar Isle mine]], requiring level 60 mining and granting no experience. It can still be mined after the quest is completed.
* [[Crystal ore]] is mined from [[Crystal deposit]]s in the [[Gauntlet]], with a chance of granting [[crystal shards]]. In the [[Corrupted Gauntlet]], [[corrupted ore]] and [[corrupted shards]] are obtained instead.
* [[Guardian fragments]] are mined from [[Large guardian remains]], [[Guardian remains]], or [[Guardian parts]], and [[Guardian essence]] is mined from [[Huge guardian remains]], during the [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame.
* [[Stone]]s could be mined during the [[Big Cats &amp; WWF]] event.

==Mines==
{{main|Mines}}
[[Mines]] are areas where players can mine their ores. These may be on the surface or underground and are scattered around [[Gielinor]]. Some of these locations are accessible only after certain [[quests]] are complete and some are [[members]]-only.

==Special mining areas and activities==
===Mining Guild===
{{Main|Mining Guild}}The [[Mining Guild]] is a special mining area within the dwarven mines, requiring level 60 Mining to enter (can be [[Temporary skill boost|boosted]]). While accessible by [[Free-to-play]] players, an area of the mine is accessible solely by [[Members]]. There are numerous rocks in both sections, with especially large numbers of [[coal rocks]].

Within the members' area of the mining guild, players will receive an invisible +7 level [[Temporary_skill_boost#Invisible_boosts|boost]] to their Mining, and have a chance to receive [[unidentified minerals]] while mining, which can be traded in for various [[Mining gloves (disambiguation)|mining gloves]]. It also contains two [[runite rocks]] and is the only place players can mine [[Amethyst]]. Players also have access to a [[Bank chest]] to deposit their ores quickly.

===Motherlode Mine===
{{Main|Motherlode Mine}}The [[Motherlode Mine]], requiring level 30 Mining and found within the dwarven mines, allows players to instead mine [[Pay-dirt]] and deposit it into a dwarven machine. When withdrawn, the player receives various random ores attainable at their current mining level. This process also has a chance of rewarding [[Gold nugget]]s, used to purchase helpful mining-related items such as the [[Coal bag]], [[Gem bag]], and [[Prospector outfit]], as well as [[Soft clay pack]]s and [[Bag full of gems|Bags full of gems]].

===Blast mine===
{{Main|Blast mine}}The [[Blast mine]], requiring level 43 Mining and found within [[Lovakengj]], allows players to collect [[Blasted ore]]s through the use of [[Dynamite]]; the usage of which also rewards a small amount of [[Firemaking|Firemaking experience]]. [[Blasted ore]]s are then deposited to obtain various random ores; the blast mine is unique as players can receive ores that have level requirements up to ten above their current level.

===Coal Trucks===
{{Main|Coal Trucks}}Coal from the nearby coal rocks can be loaded onto the trucks, and unloaded in [[Seers' Village]], which makes banking more convenient.

===Trahaearn mine===
{{Main|Trahaearn mine}}The rocks in this mine have a chance of yielding [[crystal shards]] alongside the ore.

===Volcanic mine===
{{Main|Volcanic mine}}Players may mine ore fragments from a boulder in a volcanic chamber. This may be performed individually or in groups. In order to successfully mine here, players must maintain the stability of the mine, avoid [[lava beast]]s and navigate across pools of lava.

===Shooting stars===
{{Main|Shooting stars}}Shooting stars land in random locations every two hours or so. They can be mined for [[stardust]].

===Zalcano===
{{Main|Zalcano}}Zalcano is a [[skilling boss]]. In order to defeat her, players must mine [[tephra]], refine it using the [[Smithing]] skill, imbue it using the [[Runecrafting]] skill, throw it at her and mine her once her armour is damaged enough.

===Digsite===
{{Main|Digsite}}Various digs at the Digsite yield a variety of cheap or useless items and low amounts of experience. The [[Panning tray|panning activity]] yields a variety of inexpensive items (including [[nuggets]], three sets of which can be exchanged for [[gold ore]]), and minuscule amounts of mining and [[fishing]] experience.

==Other uses==
* In [[Castle Wars]], players can mine certain parts of the wall underground in order to fill the passageway with rocks. If other players are located under the rocks, they will be instantly killed.
* In the [[Chambers of Xeric]], the player's mining level and the average mining level of the team affect the damage on [[Guardian (Chambers of Xeric)|Guardian]]s.
* Several passages are blocked by objects that have to be mined before they can be crossed, such as rocks in the [[Abyss]] and the entrance to the [[Ice Queen's Lair]].
* Mining is used to animate the [[earth elemental]]s that drop [[elemental ore]]. Although no actual mining is involved, a pickaxe that the player has the mining level to use is required.

==Tips==
===Power mining===
Also known as '''drop mining''', this is where a player fills their [[inventory]] with ores, drops them all, and repeats. While this method of mining allows players to raise their Mining level quickly, dropping a whole inventory of ores can take some time (although this can be minimised by making use of [[Update:Shift-Click Drop &amp; QoL|shift-click dropping]]). Also, by using this method, a player would be missing out on [[Smithing]] [[experience]]. Some locations useful for drop mining:

*[[Al Kharid mine]] - The scorpions can be [[aggressive]] at low [[combat level]]s.
*[[Dwarven Mine]]
*[[Bandit Camp Quarry]] - Players will be susceptible to damage from [[desert heat]]
*[[Mining Guild]] - The ores in the [[members]]-only section respawn twice as fast, allowing for non-stop iron mining.

====Power-mining iron====
There are currently nine [[mines]] in ''[[RuneScape]]'' where three [[iron rocks]] in a triangular formation can be mined without moving, thus ideal for [[power levelling]]. They are as follows:

*[[Al Kharid Mine]]
*[[Mining Guild]]
*[[Resource Area]]
*[[Legends' Guild mine]]
*[[Piscatoris mine]]
*[[Lovakengj mine]]
*[[Verdant Valley]] on [[Fossil Island]]
*[[Mount Karuulm mine]]
*[[Trahaearn mine]]

===Mining gloves===
[[Members]] can purchase two different types of [[Mining gloves (disambiguation)|Mining Gloves]] from the [[Mining Guild Mineral Exchange]] store in the [[Mining Guild]]. Each pair of gloves provide a chance of the rock not depleting, which is very beneficial for players powermining or mining higher tier ores. After purchasing both pairs of gloves, the player can combine the gloves to create [[Expert mining gloves]] by talking to [[Belona]].

===Reduce total weight===
Players are recommended to wear few items or nothing at all other than their [[pickaxe]]. [[Members]] can wear the [[weight-reducing clothing]]. Wearing fewer items allows a player to run longer, as less [[energy]] is spent while running at lower [[weight]] values.

===Switch worlds===
For higher level rocks such as [[Adamantite rocks|adamantite]] or [[Runite rocks|runite]], it is often faster to switch between [[server|worlds]] rather than waiting for the rocks to [[Spawning|respawn]]. This is not recommended for lower level rocks as they respawn much faster.

==Mining pet==
[[File:Rock golem (follower).png|right|120px]]
{{Main|Rock golem}}
The [[rock golem]] is a members-only skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained while training [[Mining]]. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Mining level, and the time it takes to gather a resource.

'''Prayer''' is a [[F2P|non-members]] [[combat]] [[skill]]. Prayer is trained by burying [[bones]], using them on an [[altar]] in a [[player-owned house]], by using them on the altar in the [[Chaos Temple (hut)|Chaos Temple]], by praying at the [[Ectofuntus]] with [[bonemeal]] and [[buckets of slime]], by killing [[reanimate]]d [[monsters]] summoned via the [[Arceuus spellbook]], or by scattering Demonic ashes. Different bones and different Demonic ashes give different amounts of [[experience]].

Prayers are unlocked as the level in the skill goes up, which are used to aid the player in combat. The prayers can help with [[Attack]], [[Defence]], [[Strength]], [[Ranged]], [[Magic]], and [[Hitpoints]], among other uses. When prayers are activated, they drain the player's [[prayer points]] until the prayer is turned off or all prayer points are used.

Most prayers can be activated immediately before the attack hits and promptly deactivated in order to gain buffs and/or protection with minimal to no expenditure of prayer points. This is called [[#Prayer flicking|prayer flicking]].

==Recharging points==
[[File:Prayer tab.png|frame|Prayer interface]]
The player can recharge all of their [[prayer points]] to full by praying at an [[altar]], which are most often found in [[church]]es.

Praying at these altars will recharge the player's prayer points above the maximum:
*The Altar of Nature in the [[Nature Grotto]]
*The [[Edgeville Monastery]] (requires level 31 Prayer)
*Altars found within the [[God Wars Dungeon]] boss chambers.

In addition, consuming [[prayer potion]]s, [[super restore]]s, [[sanfew serum]]s, [[Ancient brew]]s, [[Forgotten_brew#4_dose|Forgotten Brew]] and [[Zamorak brew]]s will recharge prayer points proportional to the player's Prayer level, and consuming [[jangerberries]] restores 1 prayer point each. The [[Falador shield]] will also recharge a certain percentage of prayer points once or twice daily depending upon the tier of the shield.

The [[special attack]]s of these weapons will also restore prayer points: [[ancient mace]], [[eldritch nightmare staff]], [[Saradomin godsword]].

The [[Catacombs of Kourend]] also have a special effect, where burying [[bones]] will restore a few prayer points based on the type of bone.

==&lt;span class="anchor" id="Prayers"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prayers list==
[[File:Activated prayer.png|left]]
The prayer tab contains all of the available prayers. To activate a prayer, simply click it. This will show a beige circle around any active prayers, and will start to drain [[prayer points]].

All prayers up to [[Mystic Might]] are available for [[free-to-play]] players, but prayers from [[Retribution]] onward require the player to be on a [[members]]' server. Additionally, [[Chivalry]] and [[Piety]] require completion of [[Camelot Training Room]], and [[Preserve]], [[Rigour]], and [[Augury]] must be unlocked through [[prayer scroll]]s from [[Chambers of Xeric]].

==Prayer drain==
{{See also|Prayer items|Calculator:Prayer/Prayer drain}}
While active, each prayer slowly depletes a player's prayer points. Different prayers drain prayer points at different rates. For example, a low-level prayer such as [[Thick Skin]] drains prayer significantly slower than its higher level counterpart, [[Steel Skin]].

''Prayer bonus'', determined by worn equipment allows a player to slow the rate at which prayer points are drained. Players can view their prayer bonus in the [[Equipment Stats]] window. Only certain types of armour, clothing, [[weapons]], and [[jewellery]] grant a prayer bonus.

In practice, each point of prayer bonus effectively increases the duration prayer points will last by 3.33%. For example, if a player uses the "[[Protect from Melee]]" prayer with a prayer bonus of 0, their prayer points would drain at a rate of 1 point every 3 seconds. If that player then equips [[armour]] giving a prayer bonus of +15, the player can expect this duration to increase by 50%, draining 1 point per 4.5 seconds instead of 1 point every 3 seconds.

Prayer bonus does not help to stave off the side-effects of locations and [[monsters]] that drain Prayer.

===Prayer drain mechanics===
Each prayer has an associated ''drain effect'', and the total across all activated prayers is added to an internal ''prayer drain counter'' each [[Runescape clock|game tick]]. Whenever this counter value exceeds a certain theshold, known as the player's ''prayer drain resistance'', one prayer point is depleted, and that player's current prayer drain counter value decreases by their prayer drain resistance. As this can occur more than once per game tick, it is possible to lose more than one prayer point within a single game tick.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/814540902542802944|date=29 December 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/hN26Q|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=The drain effect of the new Raids prayers is still subject to change. [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C03UXntXAAQd6PP.jpg]}}

Players have a base ''prayer drain resistance'' of 60, increased by 2 for every point of prayer bonus. In the example above, a player with a prayer bonus of +15 would have a prayer drain resistance of 90, instead of 60. This would result in prayer points taking an average of 50% longer to deplete. Prayer drain resistance can be calculated with the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{drain}_\mathrm{resistance} = 2 \times \mathit{bonus} + 60&lt;/math&gt;

The number of seconds it takes for one Prayer point to drain, requiring the summation of the drain effect of each Prayer as drain effect, is then calculated with the following formula:

&lt;math&gt;\mathit{seconds} = 0.6 \times \left( \mathit{drain}_\mathrm{resistance} / \mathit{drain}_\mathrm{effect} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Quick prayers==
[[File:Quick prayers interface.png|thumb|160px|Quick-prayers interface]]
[[File:Activating quick prayers.gif|left|Activating quick prayers]]
On [[Update:Quick-prayers &amp; Loot Broadcast|6 February 2014]], data orbs were added  with the [[Minimap#User interface icons|Prayer icon]] being given the ability to select quick prayers. It can be left-clicked to activate, or deactivate, a group of prayers preselected by the player simultaneously. You can select which prayers are activated by right-clicking the button and choosing the "Setup quick-prayers" option. Before the addition of this function, players had to, sometimes frantically, locate the prayer tab and activate them one by one. This function allows players to place many of the most useful prayers on immediate standby. It is very useful for prayer flicking. Quick prayers can also be used as an easy way to turn off all prayers by double left-clicking it (to turn quick prayers on, then off).

==Prayer filtering==
By enabling the prayers filter via right-clicking the prayer icon, players may alter the contents of their prayers interface based on a number of filters by clicking the "Filters" button on the bottom of the prayer interface:
* Lower tiers of tiered prayers
* Tiered prayers even if multi-skill prayers are available
* Rapid Healing prayers
* Prayers the player lacks the Prayer level to activate
* Prayers the player lacks the requirements to activate

Once a player checks or unchecks the desired filter, tapping the "Filters" button again will display the filtered interface. Unlike the [[spellbook]] filtering, prayer icons will not enlarge if enough prayers are filtered out.

==Prayer flicking==
Flicking lets a player use prayers in combat without having their [[prayer points]] drain continuously. A skilled player will turn prayers on right before their effects are required, and turn them off immediately after. This will stop prayer from continuously draining between attacks. For prayer flicking involving [[protection prayers]], the player will activate the prayer just before being hit, and turn it off immediately after the hit lands. This uses up very few prayer points, and negates prayer point usage completely if done quickly enough.

Although flicking requires timing and skill, doing it successfully can save prayer points and allow a player to fight [[monsters]] for much longer, or increase damage rates with offensive prayers. In some cases, flicking can take advantage of mechanics, such as rendering [[Dessous]] unable to attack the player. If done perfectly, no prayer will be consumed regardless of how long the fight lasts.

Most players will not have totally perfect timing. Wearing gear with a high prayer bonus will help you prayer flick much longer. Flicking is considerably easier when fighting a monster that matches your weapon's speed, and/or when playing with sounds on. A metronome set to 100 beats per minute (or once every 0.6 seconds) can be used for practicing.

The disadvantages to prayer flicking are the high click intensity associated with constantly turning prayers on and off, and the time needed to get good and consistent at it. If used in a high risk situation, incorrectly flicking may backfire as it can cause players to not have prayers on at the right time.

===How to prayer flick===
[[File:Prayer flicking (melee).gif|thumb|Flicking Protect from Melee and an offensive prayer when using a 4-tick weapon against a 6-tick monster.]]
[[File:4t vs 4t prayer flick.gif|thumb|Flicking Protect from Melee and an offensive prayer when using a 4-tick weapon against a 4-tick monster.]]
To prayer flick, one must activate and deactivate a prayer so it is active on the needed [[RuneScape clock|game tick]]. If flicking a combat prayer, this is the tick you attack. If flicking a protection prayer, this is the tick your enemy attacks (which is when their attack animation begins, not necessarily the tick in which you take damage). If flicking against monsters, it will help immensely to know the monster's [[attack speed]].

[[File:Prayer flicking (ranged).gif|thumb|Flicking offensively with a crossbow on the Rapid setting. Note that the XP drop and overhead prayer appear at the same time.]]
While it is possible to prayer flick against monsters that use Magic or Ranged attacks, it is best to practice against monsters that use melee at a 2.4 second (4 tick) interval while using a 4-tick weapon if you are learning how to flick for the first time. Practicing during [[Slayer]] tasks is a relatively safe and yet rewarding way to learn. [[Mutated Bloodveld]]s are an example of a good monster to practice at: they are not aggressive, their hits are accurate (meaning you will see easily when you make a mistake), and they are easy to reach.

In essence, when using protection prayers, activate the prayer just before the opponent's attack animation begins (for example, a ranger raising his bow and shooting the arrow, or a meleer swinging his sword). When using offensive prayers, activate the prayer just before your attack animation begins (and the experience drop shows up, if your hit is successful). To consume no prayer points, turn the prayer off within the next tick.

'''Note:''' Latency to the server is unavoidable, usually the ping at 20 to 150 milliseconds to the closest server. Keep this in mind when prayer flicking.

There are some exceptions to the rule of protection prayer having to be active on the first tick of the attack: for example, many of [[TzTok-Jad]], [[The Nightmare]] and [[Verzik Vitur]]'s attacks are calculated shortly after the start of their attack animation to allow the player to react to them switching between their attacks.

===1-tick prayer flicking===
[[File:Prayer flicking (1-tick).gif|thumb|Demonstration of 1-tick prayer, including activation and deactivation.]]
While this method is very click-intensive, it is possible to have your quick-prayers active at all times while not draining any prayer points. 1-tick prayer involves activating and deactivating your quick-prayers on every single game tick, and requires precise timing along with strict adherence to the click pattern. Notably, this is the only way to reliably protect yourself in a multi-combat zone filled with aggressive enemies without expending prayer points, and works against enemies that cannot be reliably prayer-flicked against due to varying attack speeds (such as [[cave horror]]s). In addition, it can reliably be used for both protection and offensive prayers, to nullify and deal more damage at the same time. When done correctly, your overhead prayer should be visible at all times, but you will not lose any prayer points.

The [[Preserve]] and [[Rapid Heal]] prayers provide no benefit when using this technique.

==Equipment that affects Prayer==
{{See also|Prayer items|Armour/Prayer armour}}
Some equipment can bypass or disable overhead other players' [[protection prayers]], as well as drain, restore or depend on Prayer.

Most of this equipment cannot bypass monster protection prayers, with the exception of [[Verac the Defiled's equipment|Verac's set]] against the [[Kalphite Queen]].

==Trivia==
*A Prayer bonus of +30 is required to halve the drain rate of prayers.
*In ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', the Prayer icon colour was originally yellow, but [[Jagex]] changed the colour on [[27 September]] [[2006]].
*[[Burst of Strength]], [[Rock Skin]], and [[Thick Skin]] were originally spells in the "GoodMagic" skill in [[RuneScape Classic]]. They were moved to the Prayer skill in May 2001.
*Within the game cache, there is an unused icon for {{RSL|Protect from Summoning}} ([[File:Protect from Summoning.png]]). This is left over from the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape|original ''Old School RuneScape'' backup]] from August 2007 when the {{RSL|Summoning}} skill was still being developed.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/817537442953699328|date=6 January 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/8tPNx|archivedate=29 May 2020|quote=[Summoning] was in development in August 2007, and the icon was already in our repository.

[[File:Ranged icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Ranged''' is one of the three [[combat classes]] in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]''. It involves using [[bow]]s, [[Crossbow (weapon)|crossbows]], and thrown [[weapons]] to damage opponents from a distance, and [[Ranged armour]] can mostly be made from animal hides. Players who specialise in this [[skill]] are known as rangers or archers.

Rangers are capable of having the highest accuracy of any combat type, boasting a [[Armour/Highest bonuses#Ranged|maximum of +271 to Ranged attack]], beating both [[Magic]] with a maximum of +182, and [[Melee]] with a maximum of +214 to [[Crush weapons|crush]]. For this reason, it is often used against monsters with very high [[Defence]].

The [[combat triangle]] dictates that rangers are strong against mages but weak against melee fighters.

The ability to attack from a distance means that a player can [[safespot]] a melee [[monster]] while fighting from safety. Keep in mind that some melee monsters have high Ranged Defence, so a high Ranged level may be needed. [[Crossbow (weapon)|Crossbows]] are useful against monsters with high Defence, as they are very accurate.

Players can toggle whether they want ammunition on the ground to automatically be equipped or remain in the inventory when picked up by talking to the [[Ranged combat tutor]].

==Equipment==
===Stats===
There are three ranged equipment stats, two for attack (Ranged Attack and [[Ranged Strength]]) and one for defence ([[Ranged Defence]]).

[[Ranged weapons]] (and frequently [[Ranged armour]]) provide + Ranged Attack for accuracy, + Ranged Strength for max hit, and armour provides + Ranged Defence.

'''Note: In the case of crossbows and bows, the bows provide the Ranged Attack and the ammo provides Ranged Strength''', while with [[dart]]s, [[throwing knife|knives]] and [[throwing axes]] (where the ammo is the weapon) both stats are provided by the weapon.

===Weapons===
Ranged weapons have three [[Combat Options|combat styles]]: accurate, rapid, and longrange. The accurate style provides an invisible +3 bonus to the player's Ranged level, increasing their accuracy and possibly increasing their max hit. The rapid style increases the player's [[attack speed]] by 1, resulting in the highest damage per second of all the styles in almost all situations. The longrange style increases [[attack range]] by 2, provides an invisible +3 bonus to the player's [[Defence]] level, and splits earned exp between Ranged and Defence.

!Information
|-
|{{plinkp|Shortbow (weapon)|pic=Magic shortbow}}{{plinkp|Longbow (weapon)|pic=Magic longbow}}
|[[Shortbow (weapon)|Shortbows]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Longbow (weapon)|Longbows]]
|These [[bow]]s both fire the same [[arrows]], differing in speed and range, but not in damage or accuracy. Longbows could be used for additional range, but are slower than shortbows on rapid. The [[magic shortbow]] has a [[special attack]] which hits twice, and the [[magic longbow]] has a special attack which boosts accuracy.
|-
|{{plinkp|Darts|pic=Dragon dart}}{{plinkp|Throwing knives|pic=Dragon knife}}{{plinkp|Throwing axes|pic=Dragon thrownaxe}}
| style="white-space:nowrap;" |[[Dart]]s
[[Throwing knives]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Throwing axes]]
|Darts and throwing knives have the highest [[attack speed]] in the game, but low Ranged attack, Ranged strength and attack range stats. Throwing axes have superior damage and accuracy, but a slower attack speed.
|-
|{{plinkt|Toktz-xil-ul}}
|[[Toktz-xil-ul]] also known as throwing rings are as powerful as a [[magic shortbow]] with [[rune arrow]]s.
|-
|{{plinkt|Chinchompa (weapon)|pic=Black chinchompa|txt=Chinchompas}}
|[[Chinchompas]] deal very little damage, but they hit multiple targets, making them excellent for training. Because of this, they are extremely expensive.
|-
|{{plinkt|Composite bow|pic=Magic comp bow}}s
|These bows are similar to longbows, but have a faster attack speed and slightly higher accuracy. These bows can only be obtained from completing [[Treasure Trails]] or by trading with another player. The [[magic comp bow]] has the same [[special attack]] as the [[magic longbow]].
|-
|{{plinkt|Crossbow (weapon)|pic=Dragon crossbow|txt=Crossbows}}
|[[Crossbow (weapon)|Crossbows]] are very accurate, and [[Bolts|crossbow bolts]] deal significantly more damage than [[arrows]], making crossbows effective for training Ranged. Crossbows are slower than standard bows, but are also one-handed, so a [[shield]] or [[god book]] can be used for protection.
|-
|{{plinkt|Dorgeshuun crossbow}}
|This is the only crossbow which can fire the cheap [[bone bolts]]. It is also faster than normal crossbows, and has a [[special attack]] which lowers the target's [[Defence]] level.
|-
|{{plinkt|Karil's crossbow}}
|Despite being a crossbow, it is more like a shortbow, requiring two hands and having a fast [[attack speed]], along with longer range. [[Karil's crossbow]] will only work with [[bolt rack]]s, which break when fired, making it expensive to use. This weapon should only be used against the [[TzTok-Jad]] and players, as everything else can be done more cheaply.
|-
|{{plinkp|Ogre bow}}{{plinkp|Comp ogre bow}}
|[[Ogre bow]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Comp ogre bow|Comp&amp;nbsp;ogre&amp;nbsp;bow]]
|The ogre bow uses ogre arrows. It is extremely slow; its only real use is for hunting [[chompy bird]]s. The composite ogre bow has the same speed as a crossbow, and can use [[brutal arrows]] as well as ogre arrows. [[Rune brutal]]s have the same Ranged Strength bonus as [[dragon arrow]]s.
|-
|{{plinkt|Dark bow}}
|The [[dark bow]] is the slowest [[weapon]] in the game, but it fires two [[arrows]] at once. It can fire [[dragon arrow]]s, and it has a devastating [[special attack]] which boosts damage by 30% if using arrows that are not dragon, or by 50% if using dragon arrows, with a minimum damage of 5 per non-dragon arrow and 8 per dragon arrow.
|-
|{{plinkt|Toxic blowpipe}}
|The [[toxic blowpipe]] is a powerful ranged [[weapon]] that uses [[dart]]s and [[Zulrah's scales]] for [[ammunition]]. Against [[monsters]], it has the same speed as darts/knives, but against players, it has the same [[attack speed]] as shortbows. Additionally, the toxic blowpipe can inflict targets with [[venom]], which deals increasing damage over time.
|-
|{{plinkt|Dwarf multicannon|pic=Cannon barrels}}
|The [[dwarf multicannon]] is a supplementary weapon that is set up by the player and attacks enemies on its own. There is no Ranged level requirement to use it. It is fast and powerful (with a max hit of 30), yet expensive to use, and there are a limited number of areas where it can be set up for usage. For example, it cannot be used against bosses except the [[Corporeal Beast]]. Nonetheless, it's useful and great to have on board, especially on certain [[Slayer task]]s (e.g. [[dagannoth]]s).
|-
|{{plinkt|Twisted bow}}
|The [[twisted bow]] is one of the most powerful ranged weapons in the game, being able to hit extremely high on certain monsters. It has a passive ability that increases its accuracy and damage based on the target's [[Magic]] level.
|-
|{{plinkt|Crystal bow}}
|A relatively strong composite bow. Its damage and accuracy can be increased by wearing pieces of the [[Crystal armour]]. Generates its own [[ammo]], but degrades.
|-
|{{plinkt|Craw's bow}}
|This powerful shortbow has 50% increased damage against monsters in the [[Wilderness]]. Generates its own [[ammo]], but needs to be charged with [[Revenant ether]].
|-
|{{plinkt|Ballista|pic=Heavy ballista}}
|The [[light ballista]] and [[heavy ballista]] are two-handed ranged weapons which use [[javelin]]s as ammunition. They are slow, but capable of dealing high hits.
|-
|{{plinkt|Bow of faerdhinen}}
|A very powerful composite bow. Its damage and accuracy can be increased by wearing pieces of the [[Crystal armour]]. Generates its own [[ammo]]. When corrupted, it does not degrade.

[[File:Runecraft icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Runecraft''', often called '''Runecrafting''', is a [[skill]] that allows players to craft their own [[runes]] for [[Magic]] [[List of spells|spells]]. The [[experience]] earned from making runes is small, and due to the need for constant running and banking, it is fairly click and attention intensive. However, due to the constant demand for different types of runes, it can create a very generous profit despite its slow experience rates.

Due to how slow Runecraft is to train, many players look to avoid training Runecraft, and use the experience from [[lamp]]s, [[book of knowledge|books of knowledge]], and from playing [[Tears of Guthix (minigame)|Tears of Guthix]] to raise the stat without having to train it.

With the release of the [[Blood Altar (Kourend)|Blood]] and [[Soul Altar]]s on [[Update:Zeah: Great Kourend|7 January 2016]], training Runecraft has become less time consuming for high-level runecrafters, with [[blood rune]]s reaching experience rates of around 38,000 per hour and [[soul rune]]s reaching up to around 47,000 experience per hour. Alternatively, if the player is willing to put in the effort, [[lava rune]]s can be crafted for between 68,000 and 75,000 experience per hour from level 75 and up. The [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame, unlocked after the [[Temple of the Eye]] quest, is a popular alternative to traditional runecrafting offering experience rates of up to 55,000 experience per hour.

==Crafting runes==
In the Runecraft skill, magical [[runes]] are crafted by binding the magical energy from [[runic altar]]s into magical stones. These stones are called essence. There are various types of essence, with each of these types being able to be crafted in a selection of runes.

Rune essence can be used to craft [[Air rune|air]], [[Mind rune|mind]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Earth rune|earth]], [[Fire rune|fire]], and [[body rune]]s.

====Obtaining====
Rune essence can be acquired by mining and from [[Rune essence#Drop sources|monster drops]].

Mining rune essence requires completion of the {{SCP|Quest}} [[Rune Mysteries]] quest. After completing this quest, a [[Rune essence mine#Teleportation and accessing the mine|selection of wizards]] can teleport the player to the [[rune essence mine]], where the player can mine the [[Rune Essence (rock)|Rune Essence]] to obtain rune essence for the Runecraft skill.

Rune essence can be obtained by mining by [[free-to-play]] players and by [[members]] that have a [[Mining]] level lower than 30.

===Pure essence===
[[File:Pure essence detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Pure essence]] can be used to craft [[Air rune|air]], [[Mind rune|mind]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Earth rune|earth]], [[Fire rune|fire]], and [[body rune]]s as well as [[Cosmic rune|cosmic]], [[Chaos rune|chaos]], [[Astral rune|astral]], [[Nature rune|nature]], [[Law rune|law]], [[Death rune|death]], [[Blood rune|blood]], and [[wrath rune]]s.

====Obtaining====
Pure essence can be acquired by mining and from [[Pure essence#Drop sources|monster drops]].

Mining pure essence requires completion of the {{SCP|Quest}} [[Rune Mysteries]] quest. After completing this quest, a [[Rune essence mine#Teleportation and accessing the mine|selection of wizards]] can teleport the player to the [[rune essence mine]], where the player can mine the [[Rune Essence (rock)|Rune Essence]] to obtain pure essence for the Runecraft skill.

Pure essence can be obtained by mining only by [[members]] that are level 30 or higher in the [[Mining]] skill. However, [[free-to-play]] players can obtain via trading with other players.

Pure essence can be also be obtained quickly by members by playing the [[Temple Trekking]] minigame.

=== Daeyalt essence ===
[[File:Daeyalt essence detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Daeyalt essence]] can be used instead of pure essence, to craft [[Air rune|air]], [[Mind rune|mind]], [[Water rune|water]], [[Earth rune|earth]], [[Fire rune|fire]], and [[body rune]]s as well as [[Cosmic rune|cosmic]], [[Chaos rune|chaos]], [[Astral rune|astral]], [[Nature rune|nature]], [[Law rune|law]], [[Death rune|death]], [[Blood rune|blood]], and [[wrath rune]]s. Doing so grants a 50% bonus in experience gained from creating these runes. This effect also applies to runes crafted at the [[Ourania Altar|ZMI]].

==== Obtaining ====
Daeyalt essence can be acquired from the [[Daeyalt essence mine]] in [[Darkmeyer]]. Shards can be converted to daeyalt essence by trading [[Noranna Tytanin]] located near the entrance of the mine at a 1:1 ratio. Any essence received is sent to the bank.

To trade in the shards for daeyalt essence, a version of the [[vyre noble disguise]] needs to be worn.

Access to Darkmeyer and the essence mine requires completion of [[Sins of the Father]].

===Dark essence fragments===
[[File:Dark essence fragments detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Dark essence fragments]] can be used to craft [[Blood rune|blood]] and [[soul rune]]s.

==== Obtaining====
Collecting dark essence fragments requires [[File:Kourend Favour icon.png]] 25% [[Arceuus favour]] and level {{SCP|Mining|38}} and {{SCP|Crafting|38}} or higher. The ability to use the dark essence fragments to craft runes requires [[File:Kourend Favour icon.png]] 100% [[Arceuus favour]] and level {{SCP|Runecraft|77}} or higher.

Dark essence fragments require a few steps to obtain. In the [[dense essence mine]] mine the [[dense runestone]]s to obtain [[dense essence block]]s. This requires a [[pickaxe]] and a [[chisel]]. Bring these dense essence blocks to the [[Dark Altar]] to bind its energy into the blocks. This will turn the dense essence blocks into [[dark essence block]]s. Use a chisel on the dark essence blocks to obtain dark essence fragments.

===Blood Essence===
[[File:Blood_essence_detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Blood essence]] cannot be used to craft runes; instead, it offers the chance to craft an extra [[blood rune]] per pure essence, daeyalt essence or dark essence fragment when activated.

==== Obtaining====
Blood essence is an uncommon drop from both [[Nex]] and the [[Tombs of Amascut]]. It can also be obtained as a rare drop from certain monsters in the [[Ancient Prison]], and may be found inside the [[Intricate pouch]] reward from the [[Guardians of the Rift]] minigame.

===Cores===
[[File:Mind core detail.png|right|90px]]
Cores can be used to craft [[mind rune]]s (using [[Mind core]]s), [[body rune]]s (using [[Body core]]s) and [[chaos rune]]s (using [[Chaos core]]s). For each type of rune, the corresponding core needs to be used. A core acts as 10 pure or rune essence. For example, at level 2 runecraft, one mind core would give 10 mind runes and 55 experience, and at level 98 runecraft, one mind core would give 80 mind runes and still 55 experience.

====Obtaining====
Cores are dropped by the [[Golem (Ruins of Camdozaal)|golems]] in the [[Ruins of Camdozaal]]. Each core is dropped by the corresponding golem.
* Mind cores are dropped by [[Mind Golem]]s.
* Body cores are dropped by [[Body Golem]]s.
* Chaos cores are dropped by [[Chaos Golem]]s.

==Talismans==
{{Main|Talisman}}
[[File:Air talisman detail.png|right|90px]]
[[Talisman]]s are quite important in the runecrafting skill, as they are the keys used to access most altars. Each one is magically attuned to the [[Runic altar]] that shares its name. An [[air talisman]], for example, is attuned to the [[Air Altar]]. A player may use the talisman only on its corresponding 'mysterious ruin', to repeatedly reach the altar inside. Talismans can be acquired from drops or by [[trading]] with other players.

A talisman exists for the [[Air Altar|air]], [[Mind Altar|mind]], [[Water Altar|water]], [[Earth Altar|earth]], [[Fire Altar|fire]], [[Body Altar|body]], [[Cosmic Altar|cosmic]], [[Chaos Altar|chaos]], [[Nature Altar|nature]], [[Law Altar|law]], [[Death Altar|death]] and [[Wrath Altar]].

===Tiaras===
[[File:Tiara detail.png|right|90px]]
A talisman can be fused with a [[tiara]]. This creates an equipable item that lets you left-click on the corresponding mysterious ruins to enter, and saves an inventory space. The [[Elemental talisman|elemental]] and [[Catalytic talisman|catalytic talismans]] are instead combined with a [[Gold tiara]].

==Altars==
{{main|Runic altar}}
[[Runic altar]]s are locations at which players can use the Runecraft skill to turn essence into runes. Each altar corresponds to a different type of rune. 

===Regular altars===
[[File:Nature Altar inside.png|thumb|right|300px|Inside the Nature Altar.]]
Most altars are located in another dimension, accessible through Mysterious Ruins scattered across the surface of [[Gielinor]]. This includes the [[Air Altar|air]], [[Mind Altar|mind]], [[Water Altar|water]], [[Earth Altar|earth]], [[Fire Altar|fire]], [[Body Altar|body]], [[Cosmic Altar|cosmic]], [[Chaos Altar|chaos]], [[Nature Altar|nature]], [[Law Altar|law]], [[Death Altar|death]], [[Blood Altar|blood]] and [[Wrath Altar]]. The [[Astral Altar]] is the only regular altar that is not accessed through Mysterious Ruins.

Mysterious Ruins are not labelled on the [[world map]]. Players can discover the ruins' location by clicking 'locate' on a [[talisman]]. A [[talisman]], [[tiara]], or [[runecraft cape]] is required to actually enter the ruins and use the altars.

When a player clicks on the altar, all essence in their inventory are converted to a type of rune (depending on the altar), and they gain Runecraft experience. They can also enchant a [[tiara]] if they have a normal tiara and talisman in their inventory. Use either the tiara or the talisman on the altar to combine them into an enchanted tiara.

===Blood and Soul Altar===
The [[Blood Altar (Kourend)|blood]] and [[Soul Altar]] can be found in [[Arceuus]], near the [[dense essence mine]]. No talisman or tiara is needed to use these altars as they are in the regular dimension. 

===Ourania Altar===
The [[Ourania Altar]], also known as the [[Zamorak Magical Institute|ZMI]] Altar, converts [[pure essence]] into an assortment of random runes, with a chance of bonus runes being created if players have the [[medium Ardougne Diary]] completed. The altar, which requires no talisman or tiara to enter, gives roughly 1.7 times the normal experience for each pure essence used. Rune essence cannot be used. Players do not need a specific Runecraft level in order to craft at this altar, but the chance of crafting higher-levelled runes increases with a higher Runecraft level. Players can not craft a [[wrath rune]] through the Ourania Altar; this is the only rune uncraftable at the Altar outside of combination runes.

==Abyss==
{{Main|Abyss}}
[[FIle:Abyssal leech.png|right|90px]]
The [[Abyss]] is a special region that requires completion of the [[Enter the Abyss]] [[miniquest]]. The Abyss provides access to all the [[runic altars]] without the need for a [[talisman]], with the exception of [[astral rune]]s and [[wrath rune]]s. The Abyss consists of two rings: a dangerous outer ring in a [[multiway combat zone]] and a safe inner ring with rifts leading to the runic altars. In appearance, it seems to be oddly organic, with eyes, boils, and strange-looking tendrils. Aside from the [[abyssal monster]]s inhabiting it, using the Abyss is also dangerous because players who enter the Abyss will have their [[Prayer]] points drained to 0, and players who enter without wearing an [[Abyssal bracelet]] will also be immediately given a [[skull (status)|skull]].

==Multiple runes==
As a player's Runecraft level increases, they can make more [[runes]]. However, they only earn [[experience]] based on the amount of essence they use. The number of runes made from the essence in a player's inventory in an action that gains a level is determined by the player's level before the runecrafting action, even if crafting the same amount of essence one piece at a time would yield more runes. For example, a player with a Runecraft level of 22 will craft 3 air runes for each [[pure essence]] used.

The [[Raiments of the Eye]], obtainable from playing [[Guardians of the Rift]], grant 10% more runes per piece, with a 20% set bonus for a total of 60% when the full outfit is worn.

It is not possible to craft more than one [[Wrath Rune|wrath]], [[Blood rune|blood]], or [[soul rune]] per essence.

{{notelist}}

==Combination runes==
[[Members]] have an extension to Runecraft, which is the ability to combine two runes into one item.

To craft combination runes, a player needs to take existing [[runes]] that are one half of the combination, with a matching [[talisman]] (not a [[tiara]]), along with an equal amount of [[pure essence]] to the [[Runic altar|altar]] which comprises the other half of the combination. Use the existing runes or the talisman for the existing runes on the altar. This has a 50% chance of success per rune, and any failed runes are simply destroyed. The talisman will be consumed regardless of how many runes are made. Players can wear a [[binding necklace]] to have a 100% chance of success instead.

The player may use the [[Lunar spell]] [[Magic Imbue]] to make combination runes without needing the opposing talisman. Using binding necklaces and Magic Imbue to craft [[lava rune]]s can yield the highest Runecraft [[experience]] per hour in ''Old School RuneScape''.

Players receive less experience at the lower-levelled altars. For example, making mist runes at the Air Altar will give 8 experience for each rune made, while making them at the Water Altar will give 8.5 experience for each rune made.

==Essence pouches==
{{Main|Essence pouch}}
[[Essence pouch]]es are bags that can hold varying amounts of [[rune essence|rune]], [[pure essence|pure]] or [[daeyalt essence]] for use in the Runecraft skill. Essence pouches are highly prized among runecrafters because they can be used to take larger loads when runecrafting and mining pure essence.

Essence pouches decay with use, and must be repaired by visiting the [[Dark Mage (Abyss)|Dark mage]] in the centre of the Abyss (or by contacting him with the [[NPC Contact]] [[Lunar spell]]) or they will disappear. '''Note''': The pouches '''do not''' have to be brought directly to the Dark Mage in order to be repaired; any and all pouches that are stored in the bank will also be repaired.

Essence pouches are dropped by monsters in the [[Abyss]] and the [[Abyssal Area]] after completion of the [[Enter the Abyss]] [[miniquest]].

==Infusing==
[[File:Pegasian crystal detail.png|right|90px]]
The three crystals dropped by [[Cerberus]], being the [[Primordial crystal|primordial]], [[Pegasian crystal|pegasian]] and [[eternal crystal]], can be infused to the [[dragon boots]], [[ranger boots]] and [[infinity boots]] respectively to create the [[primordial boots]], [[pegasian boots]] and [[eternal boots]]. 

This process requires level 60 or higher in the Runecraft and [[Magic]] skill and grants 200 experience in both skills.

[[Splitbark armour]] can also be infused into [[Swampbark armour]] at the [[Nature Altar]] after reading the [[Runescroll of swampbark]] or into [[Bloodbark armour]] at the [[Blood Altar|true Blood Altar]] or [[Blood Altar (Kourend)|false Blood Altar]] after reading the [[Runescroll of bloodbark]].

==Runecraft pet==
[[File:Rift guardian (follower, fire).png|right|90px]]
{{Main|Rift guardian}}
The [[Rift guardian]] is a skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained while training Runecraft. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Runecraft level, the rune the player is crafting, and the number of essence used.

==Tips==
*As training the Runecraft skill involves a lot of running, a high [[Agility]] level and the [[Graceful outfit]] will be very beneficial.
*An alternative method for training Runecraft is by using rune runners. A runner is a player that changes noted essence into unnoted essence by converting them in a [[bank]] or a shop. At the appropriate [[Runic altar|altar]], the runner trades the Runecrafter changing unnoted essence for noted essence and some fee (usually [[coins]] or [[runes]]). The Runecrafter increases the amount of essence processed and the runner gets a good reward.
*Another good way is to have an [[Ornate rejuvenation pool]] in your house and use house teleports while running, using rejuvenation pool then Amulet of Glory to Edgeville and run to the Abyss.

==Temporary boosts==

{{Otheruses2|the 2023 proposal|the scrapped skill first proposed in 2015|Sailing (2015 proposed skill)|the April Fools joke|2014 April Fools}}
[[File:New Skill Pitches - FAQ and Discord Stages Summary (1).png|thumb|Key art for the Sailing skill.]]

'''Sailing''' was proposed to players as a new skill on [[27 March]] [[2023]] in a [[Update:Adding A New Skill: Introducing Sailing, Taming and Shamanism|blog]] alongside two other potential skills, [[Taming]] and [[Shamanism]]. It would allow players to explore and travel across the oceans on their own ship.

Of the three proposed skills, the Sailing pitch received a plurality of votes in the [[Poll:Skill Pitches Poll|Skill Pitches Poll]] (36% favour), with Shamanism coming in as a close second (33% favour). Thus, Sailing is currently slated to undergo further refinement based on community feedback and potentially be added to the game.

[[Jagex]] hosts a ''New Skill Player Council'' Discord server found [https://discord.gg/t8y9cKYyKS here], in which new skill related updates, modcasts, and community involvement take place.

'''Note''': All designs, concepts, and discussions are '''NOT''' final and are subject to change.

==Concepts==
===Navigation===
====Ships====
Players will be able to own a variety of ships, starting with a lower quality vessel and progressing towards better ships and upgrades. A higher Sailing level would grant the ability to command higher quality vessels, along with unlocking the ability to sail across more dangerous and exciting areas. To traverse between land and sea, players will make use of ports all around the world of [[Gielinor]]. Ports will also provide a number of utilities such as ship construction, repairs, customisation, crew hiring, and more. There will be alternative points of entry (e.g. mooring points) for locations where having a port would not make sense thematically, such as unsettled lands. While these will allow traversal between island and ship, they will lack all other utilities provided by ports.

Players will be on the actual decks of ships and able to move around via the traditional point-and-click control scheme (a tech demo prototype showcasing this can be found below). Controlling the ship will involve interacting with the Ship's wheel to enter Navigation Mode, in which the camera becomes centered on to the ship. To move the ship, the player can simply click on a sea tile and have the ship sail towards it, eventually coming to a stop once it's reached its destination. Perpetual momentum, in which ships continue to sail in a given direction until obstructed, is also being looked into, possibly as a perk unlock. To exit Navigation Mode, the player can click on the Ship's wheel once again and the camera will re-centre on to the player. It is currently unknown exactly how the control schemes will differ between different ship types.

The ships would be customisable, allowing players to show off their achievements at sea, and will feature facilities (similar to [[hotspots]]) that can be outfitted with various upgrades or utilities to interact with. Some given examples of facilities are fishing apparatuses, cargo holds of different sizes, naval weapons (ballistae, cannons, etc.), ship kitchens, or even a crow's nest featuring a detachable camera for better surveyance. Ships will also feature a number of variables that affect how they fare out in sea, such as size, speed, turning speed, and quantity of facilities and floors allowed on the ship. There are three main ship types currently proposed:

&lt;references /&gt;

When colliding with other players' ships, they will simply pass through one another similar to how players pass through one another on land. Overlapping ships may be visually represented by shadows along the sea as they pass, with the possible exception of when engaged in PvP.

The current scale of the world tends to make the relative scale of ship and sea to seem a bit "wonky", however the developers will be taking this into consideration when designing the ship and sea regions to minimize that sense. New tech is also being looked into for providing a more immersive sailing experience, such as unrendering certain irrelevant areas while sailing to make the sea seem more expansive.

The sea is currently planned to have three different tiers of sea types: shallow, open, and deep. These types of sea will determine which ships can traverse them and how well they will do so. Certain lands are currently inaccessible until the player achieves a certain milestone, such as completing a quest. These lands will feature immersive restrictions for players who attempt to sail out to them prior to achieving their requirements (e.g. [[Elvarg]] will attack ships if the player sails to [[Crandor]] and hasn't completed [[Dragon Slayer I]]). Since an amateur sailor in a rowboat won't be able to take on everything the sea will throw at them, there will be Sailing-specific progression restrictions as well. Some examples include requiring stronger sails for storms, stronger hulls for reefs, stronger cannons for sea monsters, or enchanted navigational devices for traversing fogged regions.

When sailing into the edge of the map, the team would prefer a more immersive restriction rather than hard stops, and have proposed the edges to feature an endless sea with scenery, but also with hazards that push ships back or even deal damage to those who stay too long in the endless sea borders.

Weather is an integral part of navigation, and as such will present some obstacles within Sailing. It is planned to have the more difficult types of weather to be further out at sea, which is geared more towards end-game Sailing content. Some examples of sailing speed-impacting weather include dynamic winds (emergent which will require adaptation) and static currents (always present in the same location and can be preemptively planned around). 

The skill's launch will also feature a complete graphical overhaul of Gielinor's oceans, such as coral reefs, currents, and visual differences for the variety of sea types.

===Gameplay loop===
{{Blockquote|Whether you’re an explorer setting foot on unexplored territory, a fisherman hoping for a monster catch, a pirate looking to sink every ship in sight, or even a courier looking to move goods from A to B, Sailing has something to offer everyone. So, acquire a vessel, set forth, and travel Gielinor like you’ve never travelled before!|Official tagline from the initial proposal.}}

The core gameplay loop of the skill would involve:
# Navigating to a port.
# Obtaining a ship.
# Engaging in fun activities at sea.

====Activities====
Sailing will offer a variety of seafaring activities, which could yield a large amount of experience for the skill. Potential ideas for activities include:
* Deep sea fishing
* Hunting elusive sea creatures
* Navigational challenges, which involve safely navigating the ship across an obstacle or threat
* Courier missions where cargo must be delivered between certain points
* Uncovering new islands to explore

Passive gameplay would also be included, which would give less experience than active gameplay. Potential ideas for passive activities include:
* Recording one's adventures in the Captain's Log
* Dealing with random encounters, like bad weather and pirates
* The very act of sailing itself

There will be more information relating to the core gameplay loop of Sailing slated for late May/early June of this year.

===Rewards===
TBA.

===Integration and Lore===
TBA.

==Development==
Jagex will be designing the skill across a number of refinement stages:

# Navigation &amp; The Sea '''&lt;- CURRENT STAGE'''
# [[26 May]] - Core Systems &amp; Gameplay Loop
# [[9 June]] - Rewards
# [[23 June]] - Lore &amp; Integration
# TBD - Final Summary &amp; Poll Blog

===Modcasts===
There will occassionally be modcasts hosted by Jagex in the Discord server linked above, which is a live stream discussing various topics regarding Sailing along with a Q&amp;A towards the end. They are recorded and uploaded to the official Old School Runescape YouTube channel:

{{Failed poll|Sailing Skill}}
[[File:Sailing icon.png|left]]
'''Sailing''' was proposed as a [[skill]] to players in August of [[2015]] in a [[Update:Dev Blog: Sailing|Dev Blog]]. The skill was to consist of three main activities: ship building, navigation, and exploration, and was said to be available to [[free-to-play]].{{CiteForum|author=Mod Ronan|url=http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?380,381,217,65675810|archiveurl=https://archive.is/rUZqi|title=DevBlog: Sailing - An Overview|forum= Old School RuneScape|postdate= September 9, 2015|archivedate=28 August 2021|name=DB}}

==Background==
In July 2008, prior to the release of ''Old School RuneScape'', [[rsw:Sailing|Sailing]] was speculated to be a new skill to ''[[RuneScape]]'' due to the spread of faked pictures and evidence of its supposed release. Afterwards, it had become a subject of jokes both by Jagex Moderators, through references and {{wp|April Fools}} jokes, and the community. In ''Old School RuneScape'', the [[2014 April Fools]] event centred on Sailing being released as a new skill. However, sixteen months later (August 2015), the Jagex Old School Runescape team considered Sailing as a potential real skill.

==Details==
[[File:Sailing concept 4.png|thumb|Concept of a possible shipbuilding interface.]]
The details of the skill were expanded upon further by [[Update:Dev Blog: Sailing Part 2|three]] [[Update:Dev Blog: Training Sailing|development]] [[Update:Dev Blog: Sailing - An Overview|blogs]] and a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTRheCLQ6kg trailer] in August and September 2015. Examples included creating ships using different [[Woodcutting|logs]] at various ports such as [[Port Sarim]] and [[Port Khazard]], outfitting those ships with cannons of different tiers of [[metal]]s, using those cannons in [[Player killing|player-versus-player combat]] similar to the [[Wilderness]], and exploring new islands which could only be reached with the Sailing skill.{{NamedRef|DB}}

This proposal was concluded with a [[Poll:Sailing Skill|poll]] in which players were asked to vote for or against inclusion of a new Sailing skill. The poll ran from 10 September to [[16 September]] [[2015]], resulting in a 68% Yes to 32% No vote, failing to reach the 75% required for implementation.

[[File:Sailing concept 5.png|thumb|A player on a Sailing island, showing the concept Sailing skill icon.]]
Following the results of the poll, many of its advertised features, rewards, and locales were added separately in other updates. These include:

*[[Zenyte]] and its jewellery
*The Gemstone Caverns, similar to [[Catacombs of Kourend]]
*Randomly generated caverns, similar to [[Chambers of Xeric]]
*[[Augury]] and [[Rigour]] prayers
*[[Fossil Island]]
*[[Mermaid]]s

'''Shamanism''' was proposed to players as a new skill in March [[2023]] in a [[Update:Adding A New Skill: Introducing Sailing, Taming and Shamanism|blog]] alongside two other potential skills, [[Sailing]] and [[Taming]]. It would allow players to use gathered materials in rituals to create powerful items, along with the ability to access the Spirit Realm, which would likely be similar to {{RSL|Spirit Realm|its incarnation in ''RuneScape''}}.

The skill concept came in second place in a [[Poll:Skill Pitches Poll|poll]], and as such has been currently shelved for potential future use due to outstanding player support.

==Gameplay loop==
{{Blockquote|Study the magical power of nature through Shamanism and unlock the ability to perform rituals. Gather components, perform rituals, and infuse objects with the magic of the Spirit Realm. Create powerful items like Tikis, Totems and Poultices, and augment your own equipment with powerful new effects.|Official tagline from the initial proposal.}}

The core gameplay loop of the skill would involve:
# Foraging for natural components throughout the world.
# Gathering spiritual components at Disturbed Sites.
# Drawing a ritual circle anywhere in the world.
# Creating powerful shamanic items through rituals.

Natural components (eg. mushrooms, tree bark, berries, etc.) would be found in new nodes scattered across the game, and could be foraged with a high enough Shamanism level. They could also be gathered from monsters using a carving knife, which would give different components depending on the monster harvested (eg. bone marrow, blood, organs, etc.).

Spiritual components (physical manifestations of magic) would be gathered from special nodes called Disturbed Sites — places where the veil between the Spirit Realm and the physical world is thinner than other areas.

A majority of both components would have been untradeable.

The two types of components would then be combined into new items using a ritual circle, which could be drawn in most outdoor areas, similar to [[fire]]s.

A higher Shamanism level would grant access to more rituals and deeper parts of the Spirit Realm.

==Details==
===Spirit Realm===
The Spirit Realm is a mirrored version of Gielinor where everything is opposite to the physical world and vice versa. For example, a door that is locked in the physical world would be unlocked in the Spirit Realm. Shamanism would allow players to jump between the two worlds in order to discover secrets and unlock paths that would otherwise be inaccessible.

===Utility items===
Items created using the Shamanism skill, such as relics and totems, would provide some form of utility. Potential examples given included weapon/armour augmentation (such as stat increases or new damage types) and gear augmentation (such as skilling tool enhancers).

[[File:Slayer icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Slayer''' is a [[skill]] that allows players to kill [[monster]]s that may otherwise be immune to damage. Players must visit a [[Slayer Master]], who will assign them a [[Slayer task|task]] to kill certain monsters based on the player's [[Combat level]]. Slayer [[experience]] is roughly equal to a slain monster's [[Hitpoints]], and is awarded each time the player kills an assigned monster.

Many players primarily train [[Combat]] by completing [[Slayer task]]s, as Combat experience is still given as normal while fighting [[Slayer monsters]]. Slayer is a very profitable skill to train, as high levelled Slayer monsters, such as [[Slayer bosses]] have a multitude of both rare and valuable drops.

As of [[12 December]] [[2013]], players can earn [[Slayer points]] by completing assigned tasks.

{{Listen
|align = right
|title = Slayer level up - with unlocks
|filename = Slayer level up (with unlocks).ogg
|desc = The music that plays when levelling up and unlocking new content.}}

==Introduction==
To receive a [[Slayer task]], players must visit one of nine [[Slayer Master]]s throughout ''[[RuneScape]]''. All but two Slayer Masters have a [[Combat level]] requirement, and the final Slayer Master also has a Slayer level requirement. The tasks assigned are generally appropriate for the Combat level of the player, assuming they use the highest level Master available. Players may be assigned normal monsters to kill, or they may be assigned monsters that require the use of Slayer-specific [[Slayer equipment|items]] to deal damage or Slayer-specific [[armour]] to prevent stat reduction.

The [[Slayer equipment]] necessary to kill Slayer monsters can be purchased from any Slayer Master. When you get your task, you can ask the Master for advice on killing the assigned monsters, and they will tell you if special equipment is required. If no special equipment is necessary, they will give you other tips or advice such as if the monster is weak to [[poison]] or [[Magic]].

One of the things the Masters sell is an [[enchanted gem]]. Once you start training (this involves some begging from your chosen Master), you get one for free. Afterwards, you can buy them for 1 [[coin]] each. These allow you to contact your Slayer Master, ask for tips, ask who the monster is and where it is located, and most importantly, see how many monsters you still have to kill before completing the task. The gems cannot be used to get a new assignment; for that, you must see a Master in person. An alternative to the gem is a [[combat bracelet]], which will update the player every 10 kills while worn.

Players who have unlocked the [[Lunar Spells]] can also use the [[NPC Contact]] [[spell]] in order to receive a new assignment from a Slayer Master of their choosing. The Slayer gems automatically contact the Slayer Master most suited to your combat level; this may not be the one who gave you the assignment. It is advised to receive tasks from the Slayer Master the gems contact for you.

The Masters vary in the level of difficulty of their assignments; several of them require certain combat levels before you may get assignments from them. If you go to a Slayer Master that is too hard for you, [[Turael]] in [[Burthorpe]] may consider giving you an easier assignment if the task is something that he doesn't normally assign. For example, if [[Vannaka]] assigns you [[desert lizards]], then Turael cannot change your task, as he too assigns desert lizards. The Masters are shown on the [[map]] with a yellow skull [[File:Slayer Master icon.png]] [[icon]].

'''Note:''' Skipping assignments through Turael is '''not''' a recommended choice, as it's better to gain [[Slayer points]] from doing tasks in a row and spending it on blocking or skipping your current task without breaking your task streak, as Slayer points also allow you to buy useful items and perks.

==Slayer Masters==
A handful of [[Slayer Master]]s dot the map; each Master gives assignments oriented towards a general range of [[Combat level]]s.

|''South-east [[Burthorpe]] - [[Games necklace]] teleport or [[Hot-air balloon]]''

[[Turael]]'s [[Slayer task|tasks]] are simple, small, and easy to find. These assignments are excellent for the Slayer with a low combat level, but his assignments yield such low experience that most players find him unsatisfactory.

However, Turael is willing to replace an assignment given by another Slayer Master with an easier one, if the task to be replaced wouldn't normally be given by him (for example, he will replace a player's [[Black demon]] task but not a [[Crawling Hand]] task). This ability results in more players using his services than normally would.

|''Draynor Village - [[Amulet of glory]] teleport''

[[Spria]] shares the same task list with Turael, though she cannot reset the player's current task streak.

|None
|''[[Edgeville]] - [[Amulet of glory]] teleport''

[[Krystilia]]'s [[Slayer task|tasks]] are monsters found within the [[Wilderness]]. '''Only''' monsters slain within the Wilderness count towards her tasks. She will assign players any task on her list '''without''' regard to the player's Combat level. Monsters killed during her tasks have the ability to drop [[Slayer enchantment]]s and [[Larran's key]]s to compensate for this.

Assignments from her have a separate task completion counter to standard assignments, so players will have to complete five of her [[Slayer task]]s to begin earning [[Slayer reward points]].
|-
|[[Mazchna]]||[[File:Mazchna.png|85x150px]]

|''North-east [[Canifis]] on the bridge - [[Ectophial]], [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|CKS}} or [[Kharyrll Teleport]] (can be via house)''

[[Mazchna]] gives fairly easy [[Slayer task|tasks]] too, but sometimes he may give a very small amount of more difficult monsters. Mazchna also has the habit of giving assignments which can be completed very close to him, making it convenient to get new assignments once completed.
|-
|[[Vannaka]]||[[File:Vannaka.png|85x150px]]

|40 [[Combat level|Combat]]
|[[Vannaka]] is one of the most popular [[Slayer Master]]s. His [[Slayer task|tasks]] are usually suitable for slayers with medium and even high combat skills. He can also be found on [[Tutorial Island]], where he is the [[Melee]] and [[Ranged]] [[combat]] teacher.

|[[Chaeldar]]||[[File:Chaeldar.png|85x150px]]

|&lt;center&gt;70 [[Combat level|Combat]],&lt;br/&gt;[[Lost City]]&lt;/center&gt;
|''[[Zanaris]] [[Fairy Queen]]'s court - [[fairy ring]] hub''

[[Chaeldar]] is infamous for sometimes handing out dangerous tasks, such as [[bronze dragon]]s.

|[[Konar quo Maten]]||[[File:Konar quo Maten.png|85x150px]]

|75 [[Combat level|Combat]]
|''[[Mount Karuulm]] - [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|CIR}}'' then run north.

[[Konar quo Maten]] is the third hardest Slayer Master. To receive [[Slayer task]]s from her, a [[combat level]] of 75 is required.

Unlike other Slayer Masters, her [[Slayer task]]s also include the location in which she asks you to slay. However, she will '''not''' assign any tasks in the [[Wilderness]], as [[Krystilia]] already does this.

Additionally, when on a [[Slayer task]] assigned by Konar, all kills on task have a chance of dropping a [[Brimstone key]], which opens the [[Brimstone chest]] beside Konar. The chance of getting this drop is scaled by the combat level of the NPC players are fighting, and the key is granted '''in addition''' to the primary drop you would receive.
|-
|[[Nieve]]||[[File:Nieve.png|85x150px]]

|85 [[Combat level|Combat]]
|''[[Tree Gnome Stronghold]], near the [[magic tree]]s and the southern [[bank]].''

Nieve is the second most difficult Slayer Master. Her assignments are the same as Duradel's, except she doesn't assign [[waterfiend]]s, but [[turoth]]s instead (along with the number of monsters assigned per task).

If players have completed [[Monkey Madness II]], she is replaced by her little cousin, [[Steve]].
|-
|[[Duradel]]||[[File:Duradel.png|85x150px]]
|{{Map|name=Slayer|x=2869|y=2982|r=3|plane=1|height=200|width=200|mtype=square}}

|''[[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], top floor of the [[Fishing store]] - [[fairy ring]] {{Fairycode|CKR}}, [[Gnome glider]], [[Karamja gloves 3]] or the [[Shilo Village cart system]]''

[[Duradel]] is the most difficult [[Slayer Master]]. His assignments are generally high-levelled monsters, both in combat and Slayer levels. He also assigns [[waterfiend]]s.

Note that many assignments have [[Slayer task#List of assignments|alternate monsters]] that can be slain instead.

==Boss Slayer==
[[File:Boss.png|right|150px]]
Players who have unlocked the ''[[Boss#Boss slayer|Like a boss]]'' ability via spending 200 [[Slayer reward points]] can have [[Nieve]]/[[Steve]], [[Duradel]], [[Konar quo Maten]] or [[Krystilia]] ([[Wilderness]] only) assign them [[boss]] monsters in addition to the tasks they already assign. [[Slayer Master]]s will check the requirements needed to access the [[boss]]; for example, if the player doesn't have 85 Slayer, they won't offer them an [[Abyssal Sire]] task. They will allow the player to decide the amount of bosses they wish to kill for that task, ranging from 3 to 35 (up to 36 for Barrows) per task.

Completing this type of assignment will always grant 5,000 Slayer experience after the task is complete. The following bosses can be assigned:

{{div col|colwidth=20em}}
*[[Abyssal Sire]]
*[[Alchemical Hydra]]
*[[Barrows]] ([[Barrows brothers|Brothers]] only, not [[Barrows chest|chests]])
*[[Callisto]]

==Slayer Partners==
{{Hatnote|This section details a discontinued feature and is kept here for historical purposes.}}

[[File:Slayer Partner interface.png|thumb|right|The Slayer partner interface.]]
Slayer Partners were introduced to ''Old School RuneScape'' on [[Update:Slayer Partners &amp; Teleports|7 May 2015]], which allows two players to work together on a [[Slayer assignment]] after inviting your partner to be your Slayer partner by using an [[enchanted gem]], [[Slayer ring]] or [[Slayer helmet]] on them. Take into consideration that both you and your partner need to have '''no task assigned''' to be able to partner up correctly, if you try to partner up whilst either one of you has a task it will not work.

There are a few restrictions to prevent players being given tasks that they should not get. You will only be given a Slayer assignment that you have unlocked, have the Slayer and [[Combat level]] to complete and do not have blocked. If these criteria are not met then your partner will receive the task but you '''will not'''. You will be notified if this happens. Note that players that have unlocked [[TzTok-Jad]] and [[TzKal-Zuk]] will not be offered to slay him once instead of the number of [[TzHaar]] given if they are partnered.

Players can dismiss their Slayer partner at any time by using an enchanted gem, Slayer ring, or Slayer helm to open up the interface.

[[Ironman Mode]] players are unable to participate as a Slayer partner.

Following several incidents of bug abuse, the Slayer partner system was discontinued in [[Update:Darkmeyer Improvements|an update]] on [[12 June]] [[2020]].

==Slayer reward points==
{{main|Slayer reward point}}On [[update:First Slayer Batch|12 December 2013]], Slayer reward points were released. Slayer reward points may be earned after having completed five tasks in a row without having a task changed by [[Turael]]. However, players may cancel a task by spending 30 points. '''Tip''': You may want to use an [[expeditious bracelet]] to complete the first five tasks faster.

The rewards that can be bought with these points include unlocking new monsters as a Slayer task, a [[Slayer ring]], the ability to combine all Slayer headgear into one item, the [[Slayer helmet]], and even the ability to prevent players from being assigned a specific task forever.

Since getting good tasks worth keeping isn't guaranteed, it is suggested that players get their first four assignments from the Slayer Master [[Turael]], and then get any other assignments from higher Masters like [[Duradel]].

After getting five or more tasks in a row, Slayer Masters will hand out points when players finish their tasks. The number of points varies as the difficulty of the Slayer Master increases.

Every 10th, 50th, 100th, 250th, and 1,000th task, a special bonus is given to the player's Slayer reward points, the bonuses also differ in points to each Slayer Master. Whenever a task is done the player will be notified on what number task it is, and the total amount of points they have. This can help players plan to what Slayer Master they prefer to go next, to maximise the number of Slayer reward points in the shortest amount of time.

After earning enough points, players will be able to buy rewards with earned points. (See [[Slayer reward point|main article]] for more details)

The [[Slayer helmet]] combines the stat boosting qualities of the [[Black mask]] with the protective Slayer headgear [[facemask]], [[nosepeg]], [[earmuffs]], [[reinforced goggles]] (should the player have finished [[A Porcine of Interest]]), and [[Spiny helmet]], with the defence bonuses of a [[rune full helm]], making it the best melee helmet option for slayers. This allows for monsters like [[aberrant spectres]] and [[dust devils]] to be killed while having the bonuses of the 15% Attack and Strength increase. Players can also imbue their Slayer helmets via the [[Nightmare Zone]]. This gives all the bonuses of the Slayer helmet, while boosting Ranged and Magic by 15% as well. The Slayer helmet's effects '''do not''' stack with a [[salve amulet]] or [[salve amulet (e)]] for a bonus on [[Undead|undead creatures]], such as aberrant spectres. The Slayer helmet has a better bonus so it is recommended just to wear the Slayer helmet and an amulet of your choice (unless you have yet to unlock the ability to create the helmet and use the nose peg for example; then a salve amulet is recommended).

'''Smithing''' is a production [[skill]] through which players create a wide variety of metal items from [[ore]] and metal [[bar]]s. It is the companion skill of [[Mining]], which generates raw materials used in Smithing. Ores acquired from Mining are smelted into metal bars at [[furnace]]s, and then [[hammer]]ed into [[items]] at [[anvil]]s. Many smithable items are useful in [[combat]], [[quests]], and the training of a number of other skills such as [[Crafting]] and [[Fletching]].

==Smelting==
[[File:Smelting.gif|thumb|right|A player smelting some ore.]]
{{Otheruses|def=no|a list of furnaces|Furnace}}Smelting is the process of extracting a metal [[bar]] from a metal [[ore]]. To obtain a metal bar, a player must use an ore of the desired metal with a [[furnace]]. Some metals require multiple ores, and some require [[coal]] to be added to the furnace to raise the furnace's temperature.

Metal bars can be smelted by either using ores directly on a furnace or by clicking on the furnace, right-clicking on the desired bar to smelt, and selecting the number of bars to smelt.

[[Members]] can also smelt bars at the [[Blast Furnace]], which can be a quicker and more cost-effective alternative to usual smelting at a furnace.

===Smelting using Magic===
With level 43 [[Magic]], players can smelt [[bar]]s using the [[Superheat Item]] [[spell]]. Doing so grants the same amount of Smithing [[experience]] as smelting using a furnace, and has a few advantages:
*The player can emerge from a [[Mines|mine]] with a near full inventory of bars (aside from the spaces taken by nature runes and either fire rune or staff of fire), instead of a full inventory of ores which will smelt into only a fraction of the bars.
*The player receives both Smithing and Magic experience.
*The player saves time by not having to commute between a [[bank]] and a [[furnace]].
*The player is granted a 100% success rate in smelting [[iron ore]].
*The player can smelt [[Lovakite bar]]s without the need to use the special [[Lovakite furnace]].

===Success rate===
All metals have a 100% success rate with the exception of [[iron ore]], which has a 50% chance of success, regardless of level; however, wearing a [[ring of forging]], using the [[Superheat Item]] spell, or using the [[Blast Furnace]] provides a 100% success rate for smithing [[iron bars]]. A failed smelting attempt results in the loss of the iron ore.

==Smithing==
{{Otheruses|def=no|a list of anvils|Anvil}}
Smithing is the process by which players craft a [[metal]] item out of one or more metal [[bar]]s. Smithing is always done at an [[anvil]], using a [[hammer]] or an [[imcando hammer]]. When a player clicks on an anvil or uses a metal bar with one, an overlay is shown in which the player selects which item to forge. The player can either click the item to smith one such item, or right-click on the item and select a higher quantity of items to smith. Smithing takes place at a time interval of 5 [[tick]]s (roughly 3 seconds) per item created, regardless of the items being created or how many bars are being used per item.

:'''Note:''' Once a player has selected a quantity of items to smith, the player's character will only cease smithing once the quantity is filled, the player has run out of bars, the player levels up, or the player is attacked.

===Smithing tables===
Different Smithing levels are required to make different items. Below is a table with information about Smithing and what players can create. It is important to note that [[Black equipment|black armour and weapons]] '''cannot''' be smithed.

Smithing experience is calculated by taking the experience granted from 1 bar and multiplying it by the number of bars used. For example, a [[bronze platebody]] is 62.5 experience using 5 bars. 1 bar is 12.5 exp, so go 5 * 12.5 = 62.5. This works for all bars and all smithing items, with a few exceptions such as [[cannonball]]s.

==Minigames==
The '''[[Blast Furnace]]''' is a special furnace that takes half the usual amount of [[coal]] to smelt bars, and processes all loaded ore at once instead of one by one. Other players must be operating and repairing various parts of the furnace in order to power it, but on designated blast furnace [[world]]s, there are non-players characters who perform this action in exchange for payment.

The '''[[Giants' Foundry]]''' is an activity in which players take commissions to smith giant swords from bars or recycled metal items. These swords must be hammered, ground and polished at precise temperatures, which can be controlled by dipping it in water or lava. The player is rewarded with smithing experience, [[coins]] and [[Foundry Reputation]].

==Other smithing activities==
*Players fighting [[Zalcano]] have to refine [[tephra]] at the furnace in her prison, and will deal more damage with a higher smithing level.
*[[Barronite deposit]]s can be crushed (yielding 30 XP per deposit) to recover [[barronite shards]] and a variety of items at the [[barronite crusher]] in [[Camdozaal]].
*[[Elemental shield]]s, [[elemental helmet]]s, [[mind helmet]]s and [[mind shield]]s can be smithed at the [[workbench]]es in the [[Elemental Workshop]].
*Players can make and deliver [[Shayzien supply armour]] to various NPCs in [[Lovakengj]], in exchange for favour.
*[[Godsword blade]]s, [[dragonfire shield]]s, [[dragonfire ward]]s and [[ancient wyvern shield]]s can be assembled at regular anvils.
*[[Dragon platebody|Dragon platebodies]] and [[dragon kiteshield]]s can be made from their components at the [[Dragon Forge]].
*[[Bandosian components]] can be combined with the damaged [[Torva full helm#Damaged|Torva full helm]], [[Torva platebody#Damaged|platebody]], and [[Torva platelegs#Damaged|platelegs]] at an [[anvil]] to create [[Torva armour]].
*[[Iron bar]]s can be made into [[iron sheet]]s for little experience and then exchanged for very little money in the [[Piscatoris Fishing Colony]].

The [[blacksmith's helm]] does not play any role in smithing. [[Weight-reducing clothing]] is useful for some smithing activities. Mining rocks with an [[infernal pickaxe]] gives a 1/3 chance to combust the ore, granting smithing experience.

==Smelting and Smithing tips==
*The closest [[furnace]]s to a [[bank]] are the [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]] or the [[Prifddinas]] furnace for [[members]] and the [[Edgeville]] furnace for [[free players]]. The F2P title was held by the [[Al Kharid]] furnace until an update on [[15 November]] [[2018]].&lt;ref&gt;Jagex. [http://services.runescape.com/m=news/poh-portals-dhcb-recolour-and-planned-changes?oldschool=1 Official Update Bulletin]. 15 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, the furnace at Shilo Village costs [[coins]] to use before the completion of the elite [[Karamja Diary]], so many players find the [[Edgeville]] furnace preferable or the [[Prifddinas]] furnace once [[Song of the Elves]] has been completed. The [[Port Phasmatys]], [[Neitiznot]] and [[Falador]] furnaces are also all quite close to banks. The Edgeville furnace also gives a chance to smelt two ores at once while wearing Varrock armour with each completed set of [[Varrock Diary]].
*It is often more efficient to break up the tasks of [[mining]], smelting (unless [[Superheat Item|superheating]]), and smithing, rather than trying to mine 28 [[ores]], smelt them, and then smith them (although in Al Kharid the furnace is on the way to the bank).
*The [[anvil]]s located nearest a bank are at the south-east area of [[Prifddinas]], the [[Void Knights' Outpost]], [[Yanille]] (just south of the bank), and [[Varrock]] (just south of the west bank). To reach the Void Knights' Outpost island, talk to the squire south of the [[Port Sarim]] dock or use the [[Minigame teleport]] to [[Pest Control]].

==Making money==
{{Otheruses|def=no|making money by smelting ore into bars|Calculator:Smithing/Smelting}}
{{Otheruses|def=no|making money by smithing bars into items|Calculator:Smithing/Bars}}

Smithing offers several opportunities to make money. Players have the option to cast [[High Level Alchemy]] on the items they made with smithing, sell them to specialty [[general store]]s, or sell them on the [[Grand Exchange]]. Furthermore, members have the ability to smelt metal [[bars]] at the [[Blast Furnace]] for lowered ore costs and therefore greater profits.

Smithing in conjunction with casting High Level Alchemy is responsible for bringing significant amount of coins into the game. At a [[Magic]] level of 55, a player can "high alch" items using 5 [[fire rune]]s and 1 [[nature rune]] to turn items into coins. Several items made by Smithing can be profitable when [[High Alchemy]] is cast on them. Some high alchemy values are found in the table below.

Specialty stores are general stores that purchase items from the player for more coins than most general stores. The [[Jiminua's Jungle Store]] north of [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] village on [[Karamja]] with the [[Karamja gloves]] [[Karamja gloves 3|3]]/[[Karamja gloves 4|4]] purchases items at above the high alchemy value.

Other stores include: the general store run by [[Martin Thwait]] in the [[Rogues' Den]] ([[Martin Thwait's Lost and Found]]), the [[West Ardougne General Store]], and the [[Bandit Duty Free]] in the [[Bandit Camp (Wilderness)|Bandit Camp]] in the [[Wilderness]] (although this one is '''NOT''' recommended due to its dangerous location). Keep in mind that the buy price at general stores decreases rapidly the more items it has in stock, so it's recommended to hop around frequently if you decide to sell your items.

Other ways for making money include at level 40 Smithing with level 6 [[Crafting]] and a [[necklace mould]], [[gold necklace]] can be made at the same furnace in which [[gold ore]] is smelted into [[gold bar]]s. [[Grum's Gold Exchange]] in [[Port Sarim]] buys a gold necklace for 315 coins if his stock is zero; the price decreases 9 coins for each gold necklace in stock, dropping to 45 coins at a stock of 30 or more

==Trivia==
*In the early days, Smithing was considered one of the best [[skills]] for [[making money]]. As such, [[Jagex]] deliberately kept [[anvils]] and [[furnaces]] far away from each other in an attempt to prevent people from levelling Smithing too quickly.
*For a time after the release of ''RuneScape 2'' through around [[2006]], the in-game skill guide for Smithing had a tab for smithing [[black equipment]], although this is not possible.
*Smithing is one of only two [[skills]] that unlocks something new at every level; [[Construction]] being the other.

'''Strength''' is a player's power in [[melee]] [[combat]]. As a player raises their Strength level, they can deal more damage against opponents. A high Strength level is often favoured by players over their [[Attack]] level because it raises [[Maximum melee hit|max hit]], helping to deal more damage compared to training Attack or Defence.

==Combat==
{{main|Melee training}}
Players may receive Strength [[experience]] during [[combat]], and the amount of experience gained is dependent on the [[attack style]] being used. Of the four [[melee]] attack styles available, Strength experience is only awarded when fighting in the aggressive or controlled stances.

When fighting in the aggressive stance, &lt;math&gt;4 * x&lt;/math&gt; Strength experience is granted per hit, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of damage dealt. Fighting using the controlled stance, however, grants &lt;math&gt;1.33 * x&lt;/math&gt; Strength experience per hit, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of damage dealt. For example, a player who hits a 1 would receive 4 Strength experience when fighting in the aggressive stance and 1.33 Strength experience when fighting in the controlled stance. The amount of experience received when fighting in the controlled stance is calculated in the same way that experience awarded to the [[Hitpoints]] skill is calculated.

The difference between these two stances is that the aggressive stance solely provides experience for the Strength and Hitpoints [[skills]], whereas the controlled stance distributes experience equally among Strength, [[Attack]], [[Defence]], and Hitpoints. A player who hits a 1 would receive 1.33 experience in each one of these skills when in the controlled stance.

==Fighting aggressively==
In order to gain [[experience]] in Strength, players must choose the ''aggressive'' [[Combat Options|attack style]]. Fighting aggressively grants players an invisible +3 Strength bonus (as detailed below), meaning players will hit for higher levels of damage than they would if they were fighting accurately or defensively.

==Strength bonus==
Some [[weapons]] give players a ''Strength bonus''. This bonus, represented as a single numerical value, represents the value of Strength gain. A +1 increase in Strength bonus IS NOT equivalent to +1 Strength skill, but is rather an indicator of the ability of weapons and [[armour]] to allow the player to deal higher amounts of damage.

Generally speaking, more powerful weapons like [[two-handed sword]]s have a significantly higher Strength bonus than weaker weapons like [[dagger]]s made of the same metal. Similarly, the stronger the metal (and therefore the higher [[Attack]] level required to wield the weapon), the higher the Strength bonus. In that effect, [[rune weapons]] tend to have higher Strength bonus than [[mithril weapons]], which tend to have a higher Strength bonus than [[iron weapons]].

===Other Strength bonuses===
In addition to the normal Strength bonuses that come from [[weapons]], there are some other wearable items that also contribute to total Strength bonus. They are as follows:

[[File:Spirit wolf (Summoning).png|thumb|The {{RSL|spirit wolf}}, a Summoning familiar.]]
[[File:Summoning icon.png|left]]
'''Summoning''' (also known as '''Animal Lore''') was a [[skill]] in development at the time of the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape|August 2007 archive]] that ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' was created from. Originally conceived during ''[[RuneScape Classic]]'', the final iteration of the skill began development in late [[2006]], and would not be released until [[15 January]] [[2008]], months after the August 2007 archive. An incomplete version of the skill was present in the August 2007 archive, and assets from it have been repurposed for use in ''Old School RuneScape''.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1481226268834242561|date=12 January 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.is/qEy6Z|archivedate=14 January 2022|quote=There were quite a few NPC models, in various stages of completion and animation, yeah. Also object models. Looks like quite a bit of combat code too - though this would be the original version, rather than the versions with all the months of post-launch rewrites and rebalancing.|name=Ash tweet}}

==Development history==
Summoning was initially conceived early in the days of ''RuneScape Classic'' as an expansion to the [[magic]] skill. Three summoning spells were ultimately conceived: ''"Call animal"'', ''"Raise skeleton"'', and ''"Summon demon"'', all of which would have made use of a new type of [[Runes|runestone]], the {{RSCL|Life-Rune|xt=life rune}}. While the summoning spells were never released in ''RuneScape Classic'', players still discovered the existence of the unobtainable life rune. The idea of Summoning was revisited after the release of ''[[RuneScape 2]]'', and summoning spells that would let you "summon skeletons, demons, etc...!" were mentioned in the [[Update:Upcoming RuneScape updates|upcoming RuneScape updates newspost]] that released a couple of days after ''RuneScape 2'' launched. With the magic skill already receiving a large expansion with the release of [[Desert Treasure I]] and [[Ancient Magicks]], the idea of Summoning as an expansion to magic was subsequently abandoned in favour of making it a full-fledged skill. The first design brief for Summoning was written in early [[2005]] by {{RSL|Mod Bennett}} after he finished development of the [[Slayer]] [[skill]], but it was rejected due to not fitting with the rest of the game and not having a broad enough appeal.{{CiteDevBlog|author=Paul Gower, Mod Mark|url=https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Diary_-_Summoning:_Part_1_-_Concept|title=Summoning: Part 1 - Concept|blogdate=22 November 2007|name=Summoning Part 1}} 

[[File:Karamthulhu (unused NPC).png|[[Karamthulhu (unused pet)|Karamthulhu]], a prototype summoning familiar.|thumb|150px]]
Design for Summoning was put on hold for a few months until [[Jagex]] moved to a larger office in mid-2005, and then rethought. It was subsequently renamed ''Animal Lore'', with the idea of it being connected to the [[Hunter]] [[skill]], with players catching animals with Hunter and then training them to aid them in more than just combat. Jagex also came up with new ideas for how the skill would work mechanically, such as the animals working similarly to the existing [[cat]] [[pets]], with players levelling up the skill by having one following them as they went about their business. In late 2005, {{RSL|Mod Wilson}} created an early prototype of a new pet while developing the [[Rum Deal]] quest - the [[Karamthulhu (unused pet)|Karamthulhu]]. However, it was decided to hold it back so it could be released as a Summoning creature. Nevertheless, the follower NPC was added to the live game, although impossible to encounter under normal circumstances.{{CiteGeneral|url=http://forum.runescape.com/forums.ws?16,17,733,55350337|title=We can already summon karamthulhu|author=Mod Wilson|date=14 January 2008|accessdate=2022-05-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117074545/http://forum.runescape.com/forums.ws?16,17,733,55350337|archivedate=17 January 2008|quote=As anyone who has been keeping up with the Development Diaries is aware, I am also the developer for the Rum Deal quest, and I came up with the karamthulhu at that point. Initially, it was going to act as another food source, but this plan was dropped in favour of having it as a creature. This linked into the other little project I had completed: fish bowls. The problem was, with the idea of Summoning already being discussed at that point, it was decided to leave it to be part of this skill, rather then have it as a separate creature in its own right. I kept a copy of the dummy NPC for myself, and took it to some of the multiplay tests that we were doing at the time, including the first versions of Pest Control! The decision to keep it for Summoning was made after the creation of the graphics and (more importantly) the part where I attached the creature to the karamthulhu object, which was being dropped by the pirates. In the end, the dummy creature and the karamthulhu object was added to the game. Since there was no code that allowed you to spawn the creature - or so we thought - everything continued as usual.}} However, subsequent testing revealed that expecting so many players to have followers at once was not technically viable, so work on the skill was again put on hold.

In mid-2006, after development on the [[Construction]] skill was finished, design on the Animal Lore skill once again restarted, and as Mod Bennett had moved to another team, the task of writing a new design brief was given to Mod Wilson. After being refined to incorporate more elements of Mod Bennett's original design, the skill was renamed back to Summoning, and the final version of the design brief was signed off in September 2006. An early version of the {{RSL|gecko}} pet's chathead was added to the game files in September, with the animations for it used by the graphically updated [[Kbd head (mounted)|mounted King Black Dragon heads]], the gecko's full body would later make its way into the files with the release of the Hunter skill in August. Full-fledged development of Summoning began shortly after the release of Hunter, and would continue for the remainder of 2006 and the entirety of 2007. The first prototype summoning familiar created was an [[undead chicken]], reusing code from pet cats and the [[Zombie (2005 Halloween event)|zombies]] from the {{RSL|2005 Halloween event}}, the models and animations of this prototype familiar were shared with the in-development [[Animal Magnetism]] quest, which was released in December 2006.{{CiteDevBlog|author=Mod GG, Mod Wilson, Mod Woody, Mod Kinder and Mod Mark|url=https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Diary_-_Summoning:_Part_2_-_Development|title=Summoning: Part 2 - Development|blogdate=6 December 2007|name=Summoning Part 2}} After this, work on the final summoning familiars and pets began, and some of the assets related to them would sometimes accidentally make their way into the game files throughout [[2007]].

In January 2007, the [[Cold War]] quest was released, and models for the {{RSL|Penguin (pet)|penguin pet}} and an early version for the {{RSL|arctic bear}} familiar were added to the game files alongside it. With the graphical update to [[cow]]s and [[yak]]s in March, an early model for the {{RSL|pack yak}} familiar was added to the files, and the May update to [[spiders]], [[scorpion]]s, [[kalphite]]s and [[metal dragon]]s saw the chatheads of the {{RSL|bull ant}} and {{RSL|spirit kalphite}} familiars added. The June [[Update:Hair of the dog|update to dogs]] saw the graphically updated [[werewolf|werewolves]] making use of the spirit wolf's chathead animations, while the [[9 July]] [[Update:A bird in the hand...|bird graphical update]] saw the addition of summoning bird chathead animations, used by parrots such as [[Cracked Jenny's Tea Cup]]. The release of the [[Surprise Exam]] [[random event]] on [[17 July]] saw the summoning gecko chathead animations updated and used by [[Mr. Mordaut]], and with the release of the [[King's Ransom]] quest and the [[Chivalry]] and [[Piety]] [[prayer]]s on [[24 July]], the icon for the {{RSL|Protect from Summoning}} [[prayer]] was accidentally added to the game files alongside them. 

==In ''Old School RuneScape''==
[[File:Fighting Callisto.png|thumb|A group of players fighting [[Callisto]], which originally used a recoloured {{RSL|arctic bear}} summoning familiar model.]]
Summoning was released on [[15 January]] [[2008]], five months after the version of the game recovered from the [[August 2007 Archive of RuneScape|August 2007 archive]] ''Old School RuneScape'' was created from, and as a result, it is not present in ''Old School RuneScape''. The archive also contained unfinished versions of some of the content in development at the time, including Summoning, which had models and animations for some NPCs in varying states of completion, item models, and combat code.{{NamedRef|Ash tweet}} While content that was closer to release such as the [[God Wars Dungeon]] and [[Ourania Altar]] were subsequently added to ''Old School RuneScape'' after passing a [[poll]], Summoning was far less complete, being five months earlier in development than when it initially released, not accounting for the significant amount of rebalancing it received post-release. 

While there are no known plans to add Summoning to ''Old School RuneScape'', in June [[2021]], [[resurrection spells]] were added to the [[Arceuus spellbook]], which allow players to summon creatures to fight for them, in a similar fashion to the summoning spells originally conceived for ''RuneScape Classic'' over twenty years earlier. The three [[Resurrect Skeleton|resurrect skeleton]] spells even allow players to fight alongside a skeleton, as the original raise skeleton spell would have allowed.

===Repurposed Summoning creatures===
Originally, ''Old School RuneScape'' didn't have any artists, and as a result new content could only be created by reusing pre-existing assets. As models for the Summoning creatures were not used by anything else in ''Old School RuneScape'', they were sometimes used to create unique [[monster]]s and [[non-player characters]]. Even after artists were added to the ''Old School RuneScape'' team, Summoning models have occasionally been reused.

==Trivia==
*The [[Bloodhound]] pet and [[Gruff McScruff]] use the idle animation of the Summoning pet dogs. Curiously, the Myths' Guild labrador does not.
*The Penguin pet can be seen in the [[Penguin display]] at the [[Varrock Museum]].
*On [[9 December]] [[2020]], many sound effects relating to Summoning familiars were added to the game files.

'''Taming''' was proposed to players as a new skill in March [[2023]] in a [[Update:Adding A New Skill: Introducing Sailing, Taming and Shamanism|blog]] alongside two other potential skills, [[Sailing]] and [[Shamanism]]. It would allow players to befriend various creatures, take care of them, and train them to aid the player in various ways.

The skill concept was deemed the least favourite by players in a [[Poll:Skill Pitches Poll|poll]], and as such will not be pursued further.

==Gameplay loop==
{{Blockquote|Discover new and existing creatures around the world and tame them into friendly companions! Earn their trust and take care of them, and in return they'll aid you on your adventures.|Official tagline from the initial proposal.}}

The core gameplay loop of the skill would involve:
# Domesticating a creature in the open world.
# Caring for the creature by giving it food, a home, and enriching activities.
# Training and leveling the creature.

Domestication would involve using different items depending on the creature tamed (eg. lassos, food, toys), and would grant some experience.

Caring would involve providing the creature a home, giving it its favourite foods, and keeping it active, all of which would increase its bond with the player.

Training would involve engaging in fun activities with the creature, and would be the fastest way to level the skill. It would also increase the creature's level, making its unique abilities stronger.

A higher Taming level would grant access to new areas and new tameable creatures.

==Details==
===Animal abilities===
There would be a variety of creature abilities that could be utilised by the player. Some would help unlock new areas (such as a flying companion being able to carry the player to the top of a mountain), while others would be able to help with existing skills. The ability to track down treasure was also teased as a potential idea.

===Training activities===
Creatures would be able to be trained at dedicated Taming activities across the game. Some examples included obstacle courses, mazes, and elaborate dungeons for the creature to explore.

[[File:Thieving icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Thieving''' is a [[members]]-only [[skill]] which allows players to obtain [[coins]] and items by stealing from market stalls, [[chest]]s, or by [[pickpocketing]] [[non-player character]]s. This skill also allows players to unlock [[door]]s and disarm traps.

==Pickpocketing==
[[File:Pickpocket.gif|150px|thumb|A player pickpocketing a guard.]]
This is the act of walking up to an [[NPC]] and right-clicking them, then selecting ''Pickpocket''. If successful, you will gain Thieving [[experience]] and possibly coins or various items. However, it is possible for the NPC to notice a pickpocket, in which case the NPC will yell "What do you think you're doing?" or some other surprised saying and hit the player, dealing a small amount of damage and [[Stun (status)|stunning]] them for several seconds, during which time the player cannot continue pickpocketing or move. Because of the possibility for damage, it is recommended that players bring [[food]] - cheap foods such as [[wine]] work well.

Coins obtained via pickpocketing are obtained via [[coin pouch]]es. Players can have a stack of up to 28 coin pouches in their inventory, after which they must open them before they can pickpocket more. Players can quickly open a stack of coin pouches with a single left-click. After completion of the [[Ardougne Diary|Ardougne Achievement Diaries]] players are able to stack more than 28 pouches, with the max being 140 after completion of the Elite Diary.

===Tips &amp; Tricks===
NPCs may be pickpocketed every 2 ticks (1.2 seconds). There is no need to wait until the pickpocket animation is finished before pickpocketing again. Another attempt may be performed as soon as the sound of the item entering the player's [[inventory]] is played and the experience is given. Knowing this tip could potentially double a player's experience per hour if they were previously waiting for the animation to finish.

Eating food while stunned will extend the time before you can pickpocket again by the food's attack delay. To avoid losing time because of this delay, time eating directly after successfully pickpocketing.

A useful trick that allows pickpocket spamming is by going to the Controls (Joystick) settings tab and changing the attack option priority to 'Always right-click'. This effectively changes the left-click option from "Attack" to "Pickpocket" for most NPCs.

For NPCs with a right-click "Pickpocket" option unaffected by the previous tip, such as [[elf (Thieving)|elves]], the player may change their game client layout to "Resizable", then orient their camera so that the NPC is close to the bottom of their screen. In the correct position, the player should be able to right-click to open the interaction menu, then left-click to pickpocket without moving their mouse down to select the option.

Alternatively, just use Runelite's menu entry swapper to save yourself the headache.

===Equipment===
The [[armour|equipment]] that a player wears mostly does not affect pickpocketing, aside from several exceptions listed below. Note, however, that equipping a [[bow]] without [[arrows]] makes it impossible to accidentally attack an NPC. The direction the NPC faces also appears to have no effect.

*Players who wear the [[Rogue equipment|rogue outfit]] have a chance of getting double loot when successfully pickpocketing NPCs. This chance is guaranteed if the full outfit is worn. It does not increase success rate.
*While wearing parts of [[H.A.M. robes|H.A.M. outfit]], players are slightly less likely to be kicked out of the H.A.M. Hideout when failing to pick the pockets of H.A.M. members.
*[[Gloves of silence]] reduce your chance of failure while pickpocketing by 5%. Degrade, but can be repaired. Requires [[Hunter]] level 54 to wear.
*[[Dodgy necklace]] provides a 25% chance to avoid being stunned and taking damage when failing a pickpocket. Each necklace has 10 charges.
*Wearing either the [[Thieving cape]] or [[Max cape]] will provide an additional 10% chance of being successful when pickpocketing NPCs.

===Other effects===
The [[Shadow Veil]] spell from the [[Arceuus spellbook]] provides a 15% chance to avoid being stunned and taking damage when failing a pickpocket. Requires [[Magic]] level 47 and duration scales with magic level.

==Stalls==
[[File:Silk stall.png|thumb|An example of a [[silk]] stall found in the [[East Ardougne]] marketplace.|183x183px]]There are a large number of stalls throughout ''[[RuneScape]]'', many of which can be found in the [[Ardougne Market]]. Unlike pickpocketing, stealing from stalls has a 100% success rate as long as you are not in the line of sight of the stall owner or any of the nearby [[guards]]; if you are, the stall owner will call over a guard who will begin to attack you. 

After successfully stealing from a stall, their respective owners will refuse to interact the player until 10 consecutive in-game minutes have passed since the last theft from their stall. Time passed while logged out does not count toward removing this restriction. Curiously, this extends to any NPC that owns the same type of stall, not just the one you stole from.

It should be noted that it is possible for multiple players to steal from the same stall, both receiving XP and rewards; provided they do so on the same [[Game tick]].

==Chests==
There are [[chest]]s scattered throughout ''[[RuneScape]]''. Some chests will have traps on them, which must be disarmed using the Thieving [[skill]] in order to loot them. This is achieved by selecting the "Search for traps" option from the drop down menu, allowing your character to disarm the trap and obtain the items inside.

After a player steals from a chest, they will need to wait for a short period of time before they can do so again. If "Search for traps" is not selected when attempting to open a trapped chest, the player will attempt to open the chest and take damage; this damage scales off of your current health down to a minimum.

==Doors==
Certain [[door]]s cannot be opened by players unless the lock is picked. In order to pick a lock, right-click on a door and select "Pick Lock". If the player has the required Thieving [[level]], the door will then be opened. Some doors will require a [[lockpick]] to successfully pick the lock.

==Training strategies==
{{Main|Thieving training}}
*For levels 1-5, [[pickpocket]] [[men]] in [[Edgeville]] (3 coins/pick).
*For levels 5-21, steal [[cake]]s from the [[Baker's Stall]] in [[Ardougne]]. Another option is the [[tea stall]] in [[Varrock]].
*For levels 21-55, loot urns at the [[Pyramid Plunder]] [[minigame]].{{Refn|[[Icthlarin's Little Helper]] must be started in order to gain access to play Pyramid Plunder. It is recommended to purchase a [[Pharaoh's sceptre]] while training here, as it saves time and can be recharged at very little cost using artefacts stolen during the minigame.|name=pp|group=s}}
*For levels 55-91, pickpocket [[Ardougne knights]]. [[Bandit (Pollnivneach)|Bandits]] and [[Menaphites]] are also viable.
*For levels 91-99, return to Pyramid Plunder.{{NamedRef|pp|group=s}}
*For levels 15 and up, pickpocketing [[H.A.M. Member]]s can prove to be profitable because they can provide [[clue scrolls]]; similarly, from level 38, pickpocketing [[Master Farmer]]s provides a chance to collect valuable [[seeds]].
*For levels 42-49, [[Fish stall|steal fish]] in [[Rellekka]] (42xp/pick) from the south-west stall standing south of the western most barrel situated there. When attacked by the [[Market Guard]]s, run south, then north, west and south again around the stall in an anticlockwise direction. Guards are then trapped behind barrels of fish and cannot attack until the player moves away. This can be repeated to trap multiple guards. Cook fish on the fire in the hall with the Quest Icon, ([[The Fremennik Trials]]). Once fish are cooked, bank them through [[Peer the Seer]] after gaining [[Fremennik sea boots]] (Easy Achievement Diary).
{{Reflist|group=s}}

==Thieving minigames==
There are a number of [[minigame]]s which are based on or include Thieving.

*[[Pyramid Plunder]] - the desert city [[Sophanem]] has a pyramid where you can thieve for artefacts. As you get further into the pyramid, higher Thieving is required but it brings increasing amounts of Thieving [[experience]]. This is one of the fastest methods to train Thieving.
*[[Blackjack]] - another Thieving activity in the [[desert]].
*[[Rogues' Den]] - Traverse a maze with Thieving and [[Agility]] obstacles. Modest experience. More interesting for thieves is to open the safes in the dungeon. Good for experience and for the gems that you obtain as loot. Completing the maze also has a chance of rewarding you with the [[Rogue equipment|Rogue outfit]], which when worn will double the loot you receive from pickpocketing.
*[[Sorceress's Garden]] - An interesting game where you dodge [[guards]] and try to get fruit. Requires patience, a bit of skill, and experience, but yields excellent experience. It has four levels, each giving increased experience at levels 1, 25, 45, and 65. Bring a [[pestle and mortar]] and a large amount of empty [[beer glasses]] (can be obtained for free at the shelves in the [[Sorcerer's house]]).
*[[Stealing artefacts]] - located in [[Port Piscarilius]], players with level 49 Thieving and 75% Piscarilius favour can talk to [[Captain Khaled]] to engage in stealing artefacts from those living in the residential district. It's a good way to train Thieving while [[fletching]] ammo or [[alching]]. Requires a [[lockpick]] or a [[hair clip]] to steal artefacts, and experience rate scales based on level.

== Thieving pet ==
{{Main|Rocky}}
[[File:Rocky (follower).png|right|120x120px]]
'''[[Rocky]]''' is a skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained when training the [[Thieving]] skill. This includes stealing from stalls, pickpocketing from NPCs, picking fruit in the [[Sorceress's Garden]] and looting grand gold chests within [[Pyramid Plunder]]. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's thieving level, and the person/object the player is stealing from.

==Trivia==
*Thieving is one of the few skills that does not require any items for training, unless the player is blackjacking.
*Picking locks has a random chance of numbing your fingers, which will result in a temporary debuff to your thieving skill. It takes roughly 1 minute per point lost to wear off.

'''Warding''' was a {{UD|Warding Blog|proposed}} [[skill]] that allows players to create magical robes and armour, as well as other magical items by using fabrics and vis. Warding was first announced at [[rsw:RuneFest 2018|RuneFest 2018]] and developed over the course of [[2019]], but ultimately failed to reach enough support in the [[Poll:Warding Skill|polls]] and was never added to the game.

The development history of Warding includes the following updates:
* [[9 October]] [[2018]] - '''{{UD|OSRS Reveals: Warding}}'''
* [[16 April]] [[2019]] - '''{{UD|Warding Design Blog}}'''
* [[25 April]] [[2019]] - '''{{UD|QoL Changes and Warding Feedback}}'''

==Tools and materials==
To create magical equipment via Warding, players require several tools and materials.

===Channelling lamp===
[[File:Warding Design Blog (7).png|right|150px]]
Channelling lamps can be bought at speciality shops. They are used for channeling vis, through wards, into materials that can create magically
imbued equipment. They are also used to store any vis the player has gathered. The types of vis, as well as the amount that players can store, increase with their Warding level.

{|class=wikitable style="text-align:center;"

|-
|15
|Store water vis
|-
|30
|Store earth vis
|-
|45
|Store fire vis
|-
|60
|Store omni vis
|}

===Vis===
[[File:Warding Design Blog (11).png|right|250px]]
Vis are waxy substances used to draw wards where magical equipment can be created, similar to melee armour smithed at an [[anvil]]. Wards can be found across [[Gielinor]], or created anywhere by a player using vis on the floor.

Vis can be obtained from dissolving items or casting elemental spells from the [[standard spellbook]] at the corresponding [[runic altar]]. It can also be purchased from speciality shops in small amounts. There are five types of vis: air, water, earth, fire and omni vis.

To obtain vis via casting spells, players must wield a channeling lamp; the rate in which vis is gathered increases based on the player's magic bonuses as well as the level of spell used. The type of vis obtained is also dependent on the spell cast, so casting fire spells will result in both air and fire vis. Omni vis can only be obtained by casting spells on the omni altar found in Arceuus.

Players can also obtain vis from recycling items. Players can dissolve, un-pick and reforge various items through Warding, [[Crafting]] and [[Smithing]] to obtain various types of vis. For example, reforging [[adamant equipment]] would require level 70 Smithing.

===Materials===
[[File:Warding Design Blog (12).png|left|200px]]
Various silk, hides and cloth are used to create the equipment. Players can kill various monsters to obtain the materials, or use the [[Hunter]] skill to catch various creatures for them.

Players can also chop bloodwood and soulwood trees, requiring 65 and 80 Woodcutting respectively, for bloodbark and soulbark, which are also used as Warding materials.

===Pado's robes===
[[Pado's robes]] are a [[degradation|degradeable]] set of robes that requires level 30 [[Magic]], [[Defence]] and [[Prayer]]. In order to ward the robes, players must first learn to do so via [[Brother Jered]] in the [[Edgeville Monastery]].

The robes offer two unique effects:
*When all pieces are worn, the total prayer bonus increases from +8 to +20.
*Will of Saradomin - 10% increased damage against the following [[Zamorak]]ian followers: [[Chaos druid]], [[Elder Chaos druid]], [[Monk of Zamorak]], [[Lesser demon]], [[Greater demon]], [[Black demon]], [[Vampyre]], [[Werewolf]], [[Chaos dwarf]], [[Dark wizard]], [[Solus Dellagar]], [[Dessous]], [[Damis]], [[Fareed]], [[Kamil]], [[K'ril Tsutsaroth]], [[Balfrug Kreeyath]], [[Tstanon Karlak]], [[Zakl'n Gritch]]

As a drawback, players cannot cast [[Flames of Zamorak]] while wearing Pado's robes.

===Thaumaturge armour===
[[Thaumaturge armour]] is a degradeable set of equipment requiring level 40 [[Magic]] to equip. When the entire set is worn, the set effect "Spellwarp" becomes active, which decreases the attack speed of combat spells from the [[standard spellbook]] from 5 to 4 (3 seconds to 2.4 seconds).

As the Thaumaturge warper is equipped in the shield slot, a [[tome of fire]] cannot be equipped to benefit from the Spellwarp effect.

===Thammaron's robes===
[[Thammaron's robes]] are a degradeable set of equipment requiring level 60 Magic to equip. When the entire set is worn, the set effect "Thammaron's Fury" becomes active, which applies an additional 50% magic accuracy and 12.5% magic damage when attacking any NPC in the Wilderness. While the effect will stack with [[Thammaron's sceptre]], the sceptre will not count towards activating Thammaron's Fury.

==Other items==
Aside from magical robes and armour, players can also ward various items.

===Combat rings===
Combat ring imbues exist in-game as rewards from the [[Nightmare Zone]] minigame. These rings can be creatable via Warding using omni vis and the appropriate engraving, which would be rewards from a Warding focused minigame.

Existing imbued rings '''will not''' be unimbued.

===Skilling rings===
Skilling rings are untradeable and degradeable rings which give a small chance to double the amount of resources obtained per action (no additional experience is given). Creating these rings will require an untradeable item obtained randomly while training a certain gathering skill.

===Essence pouches===
Players can repair their [[essence pouch]]es with abyssal silk, which can be obtained from abyssal creatures. This will be an alternative to repairing pouches via the [[Dark Mage (Abyss)|dark mage]].

|}

Players can also use Warding to create a "fused pouch", which can hold 27 pure essence. It is created by combining all runecrafting pouches. Doing so requires 10 abyssal silk, omni vis, and all pouches, and requires level 85 Warding and [[Runecraft]] to make.

The fused pouch will have a 100 charges before breaking, leaving players with a degraded giant, large, medium and an undamaged small pouch. Players will '''not''' be able to obtain any kind of runecrafting pouch while they have a fused pouch.

===Elemental tome pages===
Players can create pages for elemental tomes, which will be obtained as drops from bosses such as [[Obor]] and [[Bryophyta]]. The creation of elemental pages can be done with Warding, with the cost of vis to make these pages matching the price of burnt pages.

The following table lists the types of incantations, the Warding level required to create them, and the Magic and Defence levels required to equip them.

===Anti-poison lamp===
The anti-poison lamp is an item equipable in the off-hand slot, created with level 20 Warding. It can be filled with anti-poison potions of all varieties, providing immunity to poison as long as there are charges inside the lamp. The lamp can also be upgraded into an anti-venom lamp, which would allow for anti-venom to be stored inside as well.

When venom or poison is cured via the lamp, ten charges will be consumed, in addition to receiving a five minute immunity to venom and poison.

Different tiers of anti-poison/venom potions add different amounts of charges.

===Rune pouch===
Players will be able to craft three rune pouches with Warding and infinity silk (purchased from the [[Mage Training Arena]]), with the current existing [[rune pouch]] being renamed into the Wild rune pouch, which will only be useable in the Wilderness and cost less points. ''(Note: This was designed back when the [[Bounty Hunter]] reward shop was the only way to obtain the rune pouch.)''

==Other content==
===Mystical Sleuthing===
The Warding minigame, Mystical Sleuthing, will be a hybrid training method for Warding and [[Runecraft]]. It will require completion of [[Rune Mysteries]] and the introduction Warding quest that comes with the core skill. Players will also need a channeling lamp, vis, and any Runecrafting Talisman/Tiara that is useable for their Runecrafting level. Talismans that are currently unobtainable will be made to accommodate this minigame.

The aim of the minigame is to utilise Warding and Runecrafting to help citizens of Gielinor deal with magical problems and threats. Players can start this by getting a mission from various wizards, where players will then be given a location to investigate.

Once investigated, players will tackle the threat by making the appropriate ward. This ward will then turn the threat into a hard-rocky magical residue that can be siphoned into runes via their talisman.

The Warding XP rates for playing this minigame will be no more than 1/3rd of standard training rates, while Runecrafting XP will be no more than 5k an hour.

A new reward shop is an option for this minigame, which can sell the engravings used to create imbued combat rings.

===Guild===
A Warding guild brings in the ability to add more content to the skill whilst expanding on the reasoning behind it with new NPCs, lore, and dialogue. The guild will also offer a Cupboard, which acts like a [[seed vault]] that stores various pieces of silk, bark, and hides. There will also be a bank at this guild that allows easy access for training Warding.

The guild will offer a permanent catalytic ward and omni altar. The omni altar will allow players to gain omni vis for ring imbues and the catalytic ward will allow players to train Warding without having to make wards.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Development history==
This section will note some core changes made to warding between the [[Update:Warding Design Blog|first pitch]] and the [[Update:Warding Blog|final poll blog]].
===Wardstones===
A chalky mineral mixed with vis. Used to draw wards. There are two types: elemental and catalytic, both types are created by the player via a channeling lamp.
*Elemental wardstones are a mixture of elemental vis and steatite and are used to draw elemental wards onto the ground. Steatite can be purchased from rune shops or can be mined with level 15 mining. Once an elemental ward has been drawn it can be used as a surface for warding.
*Catalytic wardstones are a mixture of catalytic vis and abraxas and are used to draw battle wards onto the ground. Abraxas can be obtained from monster drops or bought at rune shops. Once a battle ward has been drawn it will begin applying various magical buffs to nearby players.

&lt;gallery captionalign="center" widths="200"&gt;
Warding Design Blog (3).png|Air wardstone
Warding Design Blog (4).png|Water wardstone
Warding Design Blog (5).png|Earth wardstone
Warding Design Blog (6).png|Fire wardstone
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the final poll blog, the wardstones concept was abandoned, and drawing wards would be done with vis instead.

===Channeling lamps===
Used for channeling vis through a ward and into raw materials to create magically imbued equipment. The most basic channeling lamp can be purchased from a general store for a few gold pieces. Lamps can be used to store any vis the player has gathered; higher tier lamps are able to store higher tiers of vis.

&lt;gallery captionalign="center" widths="200"&gt;
Warding Design Blog (7).png|Lamp 1 (presumably the lowest tier channeling lamp)
Warding Design Blog (8).png|Lamp 2 (presumably the medium tier channeling lamp)
Warding Design Blog (9).png|Lamp 3 (in the final poll blog, this lamp was referred to as the 'Anti-Poison Lamp')
Warding Design Blog (10).png|Lamp 4 (presumably the high tier channeling lamp)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the final poll blog, the channeling lamp variants were reduced from 3 to 1. This remaining channeling lamp could be purchased from any rune or ward shop for a few gold pieces.

===Elemental Robes===
Robes or armour created via warding that have a specific unique buff. These degradable Battlemage Robes, which will also be available to free-to-play, will come in Air, Water, Earth, and Fire variants. The set includes a mask, and a robe top and bottom. All parts need to be worn for the set effect to work: increasing the speed in which spells of the standard magical spellbook are casted.

The mask will require a new unique drop from the elemental giant bosses (eg. Obor and Bryophyta) to make, whilst the robe top and bottom will require a matching elemental talisman.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The name of these robes was changed to the Thaumaturge set for the final poll blog. It was not specified if this set would have come in multiple colours and if it would have been available in free-to-play.

===Kinhunter, Venomous and Cosmos armour===
Three extra armour sets were pitched in the original blog: Kinhunter, Venomous and Cosmos.
*Kinhunter: This degradable armour has improved damage against dragon enemies in a similar way to the Dragonhunter Crossbow and Lance.
*Venomous: These degradable robes have improved damage against poisonous enemies such as lizardmen, spiders, and snakes.
*Cosmos: This degradable armour is an improved version of Lunar armour with further increased damage to aquatic enemies.

&lt;gallery captionalign="center" widths="200"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the final poll blog, these armours were abandoned.

===Runestone Monoliths===
A giant chunk of Runestone that aids with warding. Here players can channel equipment without having to draw their own ward. Casting magic upon the Runestone Monolith can generate small amounts of vis.

Warding Design Blog (46).png|Ward training - death
Warding Design Blog (47).png|Ward training - blood
Warding Design Blog (48).png|Ward training - chaos
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the final concept of Warding, Runestone Monoliths would be located in wardshops. They could be used as magical training dummies. When a successful combat spell is cast upon it, a small quantity of vis of that element is created.

===Farming===
There are two new types of patches to gather fabrics that utilises the Farming skill, flax patch and magnanery.
*The flax patch functions similarly to an allotment patch, however the amount of flax gathered depends entirely on your Farming and Warding level.
*The other new patch, the magnanery, functions very differently to a typical patch; fill them with silk moth larva and they'll begin to produce silk, keep them fed with berries to assure they live longer. Silk gathering is greatly improved with higher Warding.

This comes to at least five new flax seeds and over seven types of larva to collect and train farming with.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the final concept of warding, these incorporations with the Farming skill were abandoned, and instead some new unique Hunter methods were introduced.

[[File:Woodcutting icon (detail).png|left]]
'''Woodcutting''' is a gathering [[skill]] that primarily involves chopping trees to obtain logs used in the [[Fletching]], [[Firemaking]], and [[Construction]] skills. Players with a higher Woodcutting level can chop down new types of trees and cut down trees quicker, especially as higher levels of [[axe]]s become available.

Woodcutting is a useful skill for a low-levelled player to make money early in the game. On the map, locations of rare trees can be located with a tree [[File:Rare_trees_icon.png]] [[icon]].

[[Members]] can also grow their own trees to chop using the [[Farming]] skill. Additionally, at level 60 Woodcutting and above (which can be boosted), members can gain access to the [[Woodcutting Guild]], containing a wide variety of useful features.

===Trees chopped in quests and minigames===
* Dead [[yommi tree]]s that may turn up during the [[Legends' Quest]] can be chopped for a random log. Notably, this allows players to obtain [[magic logs]] without the level requirement to chop [[magic tree]]s.
* The [[swaying tree]] is chopped for a [[branch]] during the [[Fremennik Trials]].
* The [[dramen tree]] is chopped for [[dramen branch]]es during [[The Lost City]] quest and the [[Freeing Sir Amik Varze]] subquest of [[Recipe for Disaster]].
* [[Dream tree]]s are chopped for [[dream log]]s during the [[Lunar Diplomacy]] quest.
* [[Undead tree]]s are chopped for [[undead twigs]] during [[Animal Magnetism]]. A [[blessed axe]] is required.
* The [[windswept tree]] is chopped for [[windswept logs]] during [[Olaf's Quest]].
* A shrunk [[beanstalk]] is chopped during [[Grim Tales]]. The axe must be used on the beanstalk.
* [[Phren roots]] are chopped for [[phren bark]] in [[The Gauntlet]]. [[Corrupt Phren Roots|A variant]] is chopped in the [[Corrupted Gauntlet]].
* [[Scrapey tree]]s are chopped for [[scrapey tree logs]] in the [[Trouble Brewing]] minigame.
* [[Bruma roots]] are chopped for [[bruma root]] while fighting the [[Wintertodt]].
* The [[meat tree]] is chopped when fighting the [[Muttadile]] in the [[Chambers of Xeric]]
* [[Sapling]]s are chopped for [[kindling]] when fighting the [[ice demon]] in the [[Chambers of Xeric]]

==Mechanics==
Both Woodcutting level and tier of axe determines players' speed of chopping logs. Players with high enough [[Attack]] levels can equip the axes that match the respective metals, but having an axe equipped is not necessary in order to chop a tree; having one in the player's inventory also works.

Most trees follow the same mechanics when cut, rolling to chop a log every 4 game [[RuneScape clock|ticks]]. All trees have different chances to chop a log depending on the tree being cut, the player's Woodcutting level, and the axe being used. With a high Woodcutting level and a good axe, a 100% success rate can be achieved when cutting certain lower-level trees.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1003748614546522117|date=4 June 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/FnPDT|archivedate=28 May 2020|quote=For oaks and below, a high-level player can get 100% success per roll with an adamant axe, so a rune axe would not help. This is not the case for willows or above.}}

Most trees that can give more than one log have a 1 in 8 chance of depleting, however there is a 1 in 11 chance of depleting a section of a [[Redwood|Redwood tree]], and [[Mature juniper tree]]s have the lowest chance of depleting of any tree, at a rate of 1 in 16 when a log is received. These rolls made to deplete the tree are made each time a log is obtained.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1107622474978598912|date=18 March 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.is/P3YKR|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=Yes, it's 1/16 for them.}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod John C|url=https://twitter.com/JagexJohnC/status/738666528384647168|date=3 June 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/eED9w|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=After the update, the chance of a redwood tree depleting will have decreased from 1 in 16 to 1 in 11.}}{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod John C|url=https://twitter.com/JagexJohnC/status/738669067838574592|date=3 June 2016|archiveurl=https://archive.is/1PYWQ|archivedate=30 May 2020|quote=All other trees are 1 in 8.}}

After a tree depletes, a timer counts down to its respawn. Each tree has its own timer and is roughly related to the tier of tree. [[Oak]] and [[willow]] trees take 8.4 seconds, [[maple tree]]s take 35.4 seconds, [[yew]]s take 59.4 seconds, and [[Magic tree|magic]] and [[Redwood|redwood trees]] take 119.4 seconds. 

Due to these mechanics, when a group of players are sharing trees, more experience per hour is earned and less clicking is required when the players spread out among different trees instead of chopping down the same one. This is because more individual trees can spend time respawning and each player isn't wasting ticks swinging at a depleted tree. As well, on average, individual trees will last longer as less rolls are being made per period of time as each player makes their own roll every 4 ticks saving time walking from tree to tree.{{CiteTwitter|author=Mod Ash|url=https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1545828673026129920|date=9 July 2022|archiveurl=https://archive.ph/KjPfd|archivedate=9 July 2022|quote=Each time someone gets a log, the tree rolls a flat rate of falling. So if people are getting logs twice as often, I imagine it's *roughly* twice as likely to fall in the same amount of time, though I've not tried calculating the exact effect on the distribution.}}

While woodcutting most standard trees, players have a 1/256 chance to receive [[bird nest]]s, which fall to the floor and can be picked up. These may be empty, or contain various rings, tree seeds, and rarely a [[bird's egg]]. The nests themselves are valuable in their [[crushed nest|crushed form]] for use in making [[Saradomin Brew]]s with the [[Herblore]] skill.

The player may also obtain [[clue nest]]s in a similar fashion, which contain a [[clue scroll]] between beginner and elite tiers. While regular bird nests aren't obtainable through chopping redwood trees, clue nests are. Unlike normal nests these rates are affected by the type of tree and Woodcutting level.

==Special woodcutting locations and activities==
Several locations have unique mechanics that related to woodcutting.

===Woodcutting Guild===
{{Main|Woodcutting Guild}}The [[Woodcutting guild]] is located in the south-western corner of [[Hosidius]], providing various woodcutting features for [[members]]. The guild requires at least level 60 woodcutting and 75% Hosidius [[favour]] to enter. Within the guild, players receive an [[Invisible boost|invisible +7 boost]] to their woodcutting skill, allowing them to chop trees significantly faster, but not trees that require a woodcutting level above their visible level.

The guild contains a wide variety of trees found across [[Gielinor]], including higher level [[yew]] and [[magic tree]]s; all found in close proximity to both a [[sawmill]] and [[bank]]. It is the only location of [[Redwood|redwood trees]] in the game, except for those grown by the player within the [[Farming guild]]. Other notable features include:
* [[Perry's Chop-chop Shop]], the only shop in ''[[Old School RuneScape]]'' that sells [[rune axe]]s.
* A dungeon containing many [[Ents]]

===Canoes===
{{main|Canoe}}
[[Canoes]] are a way of travelling along the [[River Lum]]. All that is required to use them is an [[axe]] and a minimum of level 12 Woodcutting for the lowest level canoe. There are five canoe stations and six stops.

Canoes are a very handy way of getting to [[Edgeville]] without an [[amulet of glory]].

Note that while the [[Wilderness]] is the last stop, there are no suitable trees to make a canoe, so it is a one-way trip. It drops players off just north of the [[Black chinchompa (Hunter)|black chinchompa]] hunting grounds.

===Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup===
{{main|Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup}}
Tai Bwo Wannai Cleanup is a woodcutting minigame that revolves around hacking jungle bushes around [[Tai Bwo Wannai]] with a machete for [[thatch spar]]s and using them to repair the village fence. Both actions grant favour with the locals, which can be exchanged for [[trading stick]]s. Furthermore, [[gout tuber]]s, [[proboscis|proboscides]], [[snake hide]], [[uncut opal]]s, [[uncut jade]]s, [[uncut red topaz]]es and [[tribal mask]]s may be obtained from creatures and rocks that occasionally spawn upon successfully clearing a jungle bush.

===Prifddinas===
{{main|Prifddinas}}
The [[Tree|regular trees]], [[teak]] trees, [[mahogany]] trees, [[yew tree]]s and [[magic tree]]s found within the walls of Prifddinas have a 1/80 chance of producing a [[crystal shard]] in addition to the main product. Despite their models also having embedded crystals, the trees in [[Gwenith]] do not yield crystal shards.

===Ents===
{{main|Ent}}
Ents are monsters found in the [[Wilderness]] and at the [[Woodcutting guild]]. They become ent trunks when killed, which can be chopped for random [[noted]] logs until it despawns. Ents in the wilderness produce logs at twice the rate of logs from ents at the Woodcutting Guild. Completing the medium tier of the [[Wilderness Diary]] further increases the rate.

===Farmable trees===
Oaks, willows, maples, yew trees and magic trees can be planted in any of six [[tree patch]]es found throughout Gielinor. Teaks and mahoganies can be planted in any of three [[hardwood patch]]es on [[Fossil Island]]. [[Crystal tree]]s can be planted in the [[crystal tree patch]] in [[Prifddinas]]. [[Celastrus tree]]s can be planted in the dedicated [[celastrus patch]] and redwood trees in the dedicated [[redwood tree patch]], both found in the advanced tier of the [[Farming Guild]]. Crystal trees and celastrus do not grant woodcutting experienced when chopped.

Farmable trees offer the benefit of being visible only to the player who has planted it, thus removing competition. Attempting to chop a tree in a farming patch causes the player to stall for one [[tick]], which allows for [[Tick manipulation#1.5-tick Woodcutting|1.5-tick woodcutting]].

===Obstacles===
Several obstacles can traversed by chopping them with an axe or machete. These include:
* [[Jungle bush]]es and [[jungle tree]]s blocking the entrance to the [[Kharazi jungle]]. In addition to being crossed when chopped, they yield [[logs]].
* [[Dead tree (Mountain Camp)|Dead trees]] found north of the [[Shining Pool]] block the [[Kendal]]'s cave. Only two of the trees can be chopped, the others produce the message "There is nothing to gain from chopping down this tree". These grant no logs and no experience.
* [[Tendrils (Abyss)|Tendrils]] blocking access to the inner ring of the [[Abyss]].
* [[Thick vines]] blocking various pathways in the [[Tar Swamp]]. They grant 2 experience when chopped.
* [[Vines (Brimhaven Dungeon)|Vines]] blocking certain passageways in the [[Brimhaven Dungeon]]. They grant no experience when chopped.

===Other===
* The [[Maple tree|maples]] found on [[Miscellania]] can only be chopped after getting to a certain point during [[Throne of Miscellania]]. The player won't receive any logs upon cutting these specific trees, instead the kingdom keeps them, and grants you some favour in gratitude for woodcutting for them. Similarly, the [[Teak|teaks]] and [[Mahogany|mahoganies]] found on [[Etceteria]] can only be chopped after [[Royal Trouble]] has been completed, immediately granting the logs to the kingdom and earning some favour as a player. The [[evergreen]]s found on both islands are not considered part of the kingdom, thus behave normally.
* After completion of the medium tier of the [[Kandarin Diary]], the maples in [[Seers' Village]] grant 10% extra experience.
* Fruit trees planted in [[fruit tree patch]]es can be chopped down at any level, granting no experience.
* The [[woodcutting stump]] in [[Neitiznot]] can be used to make [[split log]]s and [[Neitiznot shield]]s from [[arctic pine logs]], the former granting 5 woodcutting experience.

==Other Equipment==
Besides axes, other equipment is useful for the Woodcutting skill.

==Woodcutting pet==
[[File:Beaver (follower).png|right|175px]]
{{Main|Beaver}}
The [[beaver]] is a skilling [[pet]] that can be obtained while training Woodcutting. The chances of getting it are dependent on the player's Woodcutting level, and the time it takes to gather a resource. Chopping [[ent]] trunks and [[Bruma root|bruma roots]] '''will not''' give players a chance to receive this pet.
